Title:  Musical Approach

Browne works with a sympathetic set of vocalists and instrumentalists here, and makes full use of their talents. The extraordinary [David Lindley][lindley] plays violin and guitar and, as usual, always seems to perfectly complement Browne's vocals. The general musical approach is slow and thoughtful, with Browne's music leaving lots of space for other vocalists and musicians, and allowing the listener time for appreciation of each word and phrase. With only eight tracks on the album, and an average track length of five to six minutes, Browne is here venturing beyond the typical formats for both Top 40 recording artists and folk singers. The musical accompaniment is rich and finely etched, carefully crafted to support and extend each of the songs in unique ways.
