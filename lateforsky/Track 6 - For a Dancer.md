Title:  Track 6: For a Dancer

Where "The Road and the Sky" is the album's manic rocker, celebrating the ups and downs of the romantic quest, "For a Dancer" is its quiet heart, examining the meaning of death.

I find this track remarkable in that it combines a very personal tale of loss with an examination of the meaning of physical death, and does justice to both.

While songwriters are practiced at dealing with the subject of love, singing about death is a much more difficult task. Browne succeeds here by combining specific and personal details with a very clear and unusual perspective.

The recording begins with just Jackson's voice and piano, singing slowly and thoughtfully.

> Keep a fire burning in your eye.  
> Pay attention to the open sky.  
> You never know what will be coming down.

Note Browne's oblique approach to his subject, as well as another usage of the sky as a symbol, this time in the sense of a prime mover from which events emerge, an infinite and unforgiving source of beginnings and endings.

Now Browne moves closer to the central event of the song.

> I don't remember losing track of you.  
> You were always dancing in and out of view.  
> I must have thought you'd always be around,  
> Always keeping things real by playing the clown.  
> Now you're nowhere to be found.

He continues his oblique approach, talking at first only about "losing track" of someone. Also, note that he is singing to the person he has lost, as if the dancer were in some sense still present in his life. In these few lines he also deftly introduces the theme of dancing, and uses the term in the sense of moving closer and farther away, this playful use of the term resonating with the image of the dancer playing the clown. Finally, though, Browne states that she is nowhere to be found, the sombre tone of this final line suggesting her physical death.

Doug Haywood's bass joins Browne on "found," the last word of the last line, and begins an eloquent, questioning dialogue with Browne's piano. Now drums join them as well at the beginning of the next verse, accelerating the pace of the song and providing it with a more regular forward movement, somewhat counteracting the direct introduction of the song's subject.

> I don't know what happens when people die.  
> Can't seem to grasp it as hard as I try.  
> It's like a song I can hear,   
> Playing right in my ear,  
> That I can't sing:  
> I can't help listening.

Note how Browne pulls back from the direct examination of the dancer's death, into a more general discussion of the subject, thus avoiding an immersion into pathos. His matter-of-fact statement that he doesn't know what happens when people die catches us a bit off-guard, and pulls us into more emotionally neutral territory, perfectly setting us up for the surprise and searing depth of the simile that follows, comparing death to an elusive tune that the singer can hear but not reproduce.

Now Browne returns to the personal tale, standing at graveside as his friend is lowered into her grave. As you listen, note that the singer is now joined by additional musicians and background singers, creating a sense of a shared community, serving the same function in the song as friends and family might at an actual service, helping to reduce our sense of loss by reminding us of those we still have by our side.

> And I can't help feeling stupid standing 'round,  
> Crying as they ease you down,  
> 'Cause I know that you'd rather we were dancing:  
> Dancing our sorrow away,  
> (Right on dancing)  
> No matter what fate chooses to play.  
> (There's nothing you can do about it anyway.)  

Here, again, Browne skirts any typical treatment of his subject matter, for though he reports his tears, the emotion he comments on is of feeling stupid. Still addressing the lost dancer, he now talks of dancing directly, and as a way of finding joyful purpose despite the vagaries of life. Expressing this joy, his voice surges on the last line, soaring above the instruments.

As the musical group starts the next verse, they do so with a sense of joy and unison, banding together to confront the darkness.

> Just do the steps that you've been shown,  
> By everyone you've ever known,  
> Until the dance becomes your very own,  
> No matter how close to yours  
> Another's steps have grown:  
> In the end there is one dance you'll do alone.

Here it is almost as if the dancer is speaking to the singer, rather than the other way around. The dancer's message emphasizes both the community in which we grow, and that nurtures us, as well as the individuality of each person's expression within that community, and the ultimate isolation wrought by death.

Note how the music matches the words on the last line, with the background singers growing quiet, leaving Browne to sing those words alone.

David Lindley's violin plays now, finally giving voice to the sadness Browne has avoided directly confronting with his words, yet at the same time dancing himself, as if expressing the spirit of the lost dancer, as well as those who mourn her passing.

With Lindley now having touched the tragic core of the singer's tale, Browne is now freed to step back and take a broader view.

> Keep a fire for the human race.  
> Let your prayers go drifting into space.  
> You never know what will be coming down.

Note how the words here mirror the first three lines that started the song, starting with "Keep a fire" and ending with "You never know what will be coming down." Yet something has changed, for the singer is no longer alone, but is accompanied by others this time around, both instrumentalists and singers. At the same time, his view is broader, taking the perspective of the human race as a whole, in contrast to the individual lives of the singer and the dancer with which he started.

> Perhaps a better world is drawing near...  
> Just as easily it could all disappear,  
> Along with whatever meaning you might have found.  
> Don't let the uncertainty turn you around,  
> (The world keeps turning around and around).   
> Go on and make a joyful sound.

Here Browne speaks directly to the album's thematic core, talking about our need to create meaning for ourselves and others, even if that meaning has no ultimate reality. Again, as in "The Road and the Sky," Browne clearly chooses a side, chooses joy and meaning and intention, despite their lack of permanence, despite the absence of any indication that these arise from any source other than the human spirit itself.

Browne and company now launch triumphantly into the final verse, again seemingly expressing a message from the missing dancer.

> Into a dancer you have grown,  
> From a seed somebody else has thrown:  
> Go on ahead and throw some seeds of your own,  
> And somewhere between the time you arrive  
> And the time you go,  
> May lie a reason you were alive,  
> But you'll never know.

So now the song concludes with the singer having himself become a dancer. Now we can see that the dramatic movement of the song has not been into death, but a transcendence of death, with the lost dancer passing something on to the singer who remains behind. The song ends not with a death but with a birth, as if the singer has emerged from a chrysalis. He now knows what it means to dance, to create meaning through his movements, even though the universe may never acknowledge that meaning.

Musically, the song ends with piano, bass, organ and violin dancing together one last time before bringing the track to a close.

I can't think of another song that is at the same time so sombre and so joyous, that deals with such a tragic event and at the same time delivers such a sense of overarching meaning and purpose, that so skillfully manages to evoke the tragedy and finality of death, yet places that death in a larger context, without resorting to some divine _deus ex machina_ as the source of that context.  

This song is just a magnificent achievement.
