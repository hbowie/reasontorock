The title track starts the album with a very personal picture, capturing a romantic pair just at the very moment of disenchantment and disillusionment. As we watch and listen, Browne painfully scapes away the patina of illusion and gradually reveals the lonely reality lying beneath. 

The words here tie back to the cover art: Browne could be singing to us from the upstairs bedroom depicted there, and when he talks about tracing the lovers' steps until they vanished into the air, that infinite blue sky of the cover shows where those steps end.

But Browne's intent here, and the song's effect, is more than just portraiture: he's asking open-ended questions that have no clear answers, and that can by extension be applied to all human relationships. Did these two once love each other? Were they ever really together? If so, what happened to the love they once felt? Where did it go? At what point was the love lost? How could they go from such intimate feelings of togetherness to feelings of being so profoundly alone?  And is one state more real than the other? Is the state of enchantment illusory, or is it the most profound reality that humans can know, even if it transitory? 

> The words had all been spoken,  
> And somehow the feeling still wasn't right,  
> And still we continued on through the night;  
> Tracing our steps from the beginning,  
> Until they vanished into the air:  
> Trying to understand how our lives had led us there.
> 
> Looking hard into your eyes,  
> There was nobody I'd ever known:  
> Such an empty surprise, to feel so alone.
> 
> Now for me some words come easy,  
> But I know that they don't mean that much,  
> Compared with the things that are said when lovers touch.  
> You never knew what I loved in you,  
> I don't know what you loved in me:  
> Maybe the picture of somebody you were hoping I might be.
>
> Awake again, I can't pretend, and I know I'm alone,  
> And close to the end of the feeling we've known.
> 
> How long have I been sleeping?  
> How long have I been drifting alone through the night?  
> How long have I been dreaming I could make it right,  
> If I closed my eyes, and tried with all my might,  
> To be the one you need?
>
> Awake again, I can't pretend, and I know I'm alone,  
> And close to the end of the feeling we've known.
>
> How long have I been sleeping?  
> How long have I been drifting alone through the night?  
> How long have I been running for that morning flight,  
> Through the whispered promises and the changing light  
> Of the bed where we both lie...  
> Late for the sky.

One of the things worth noting is the song's structure. This is not a typical verse/chorus pop song: Browne bends the arc of the song to reflect his meaning. The first two verses, talking about words, are slow and reflective. But when Browne asks, "How long have I been sleeping?", the music shifts, starting to surge and rise, questing, seeking some release or resolution.  

Also worthy of mention is David Lindley's beautiful, delicate, guitar work throughout the song. When Browne sings about the meaning of words compared to a lover's touch, Lindley's tender caressing of his strings seems to represent that physical dimension missing from Browne's narrative. 

Although pop songs of all kinds have talked about relationships, both successful and failed, most describe the highs and the lows: few if any have chosen to so honestly focus on this moment of crumbling, to so nakedly portray the lovers still in each other's physical presence, but with the illusions about each other having been stripped away. Browne is neither romanticizing, nor demonizing, nor mourning his lover, but instead is painfully showing what's left when those emotional overlays are removed.  

Part of Browne's achievement here lies in his avoidance of the histrionics that usually accompany failing relationships. There is no self-pity, no condemnation, no harsh words, slamming doors or fights. The song, as well as the story it tells, betray an absence of any of these mechanisms we usually use to distance ourselves from the emptiness at the core of these situations. By avoiding these, Browne accomplishes the difficult task of bringing us right to the heart of the loss he feels, and lets us feel it with him, rather than simply telling us about it.

By avoiding use of these other dramatic elements, Browne is also able to focus much more clearly on the heart of the matter: the loss of meaning that the two once attached to each other and their relationship. In fact, the primary scene painted by the song is one of people going through the motions of a relationship, yet bereft of any of the usual meaning associated with such actions. This opening scene clearly sets the stage for the issues of enchantment and disenchantment that will be explored through the rest of the album.
