As it happens, I'm not the only one who holds this album in such high regard. 

Here are the words delivered by Bruce Springsteen on the occasion of [Jackson Browne's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004][hof].

> In seventies post-Vietnam America, there was no album that captured the fall from Eden, the long slow afterburn of the sixties, its heartbreak, its disappointments, its spent possibilities, better than Jackson's masterpiece, <cite>Late for the Sky</cite>.
>
> It's just a beautiful body of work. It's essential in making sense of the times. "Before the Deluge" still gives me goose-bumps, and it raises me to cause. "Late for the Sky," when those car doors slam at the end of the record, they still bring tears to my eye. And there was no more searching, yearning, loving music made for and about America at the time.
>
> In this and so much of Jackson's writing, you see the slow, meticulous crafting of the songs, the thoughtfulness. Jackson was one of the first songwriters I'd met who demonstrated the value of thinking hard about what you were saying, your subject.

And here are some thoughts from Stephen Holden, who penned the original [Rolling Stone album review][rsreview]: 

> Like Browne's two previous albums, *Late for the Sky* contains no lyric sheet. The three or four hours required to make a full transcription will, however, be well worth the effort for anyone interested in discovering lyric genius. I can't think of another writer who merges with such natural grace and fluidity his private and public personas in a voice that is morally compelling yet noncoercive.

Hopefully these testimonials will be enough to convince you to join me on the rest of this journey exploring Browne's greatest work.
