Let's now consider the album title: "Late for the Sky." The phrase seems to have no possible literal sense -- the sky is always there, so how can one be late for it? -- so it demands a more nuanced reading. 

The word "late" suggests both intention and failure: one meant to make the show, but did not get there in time. It also suggests a strong sense of the temporal: timing, as they say, is everything. 

The word "sky" suggests something vast and unchanging, existing beyond the bounds of normal human time. It also suggests a form of universal human aspiration, a symbol of our best intentions (especially in a year when humanity had landed on the moon only five years earlier). 

Combined, the two words suggest missed opportunities, a gap between aspirations and reality, the difference between limited human abilities and limitless dreams and aspirations. 

And so, in a mere four words, Browne has outlined the overall sweep of the album.
