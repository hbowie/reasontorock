Title:  Track 5: The Road and the Sky

Seq:    11

Level:  2

Body: 

This is the song that opens the second side of the original album, and it is also the central linchpin for the varied  themes of the album, the recording that brings together all the album's various elements and places them in relationship to one another.

The first thing to note is that, despite the sorrow and tragedy running through the album, this is an upbeat song, a rocker, one filled with a sense of lunatic optimism. David Lindley's slide guitar, elsewhere used with haunting restraint, here gets amped up, propelling Browne's vocals along at a breakneck pace.

The lyrics start with clearly symbolic intent, echoing the album's title.

> When we come to the place  
> Where the road and the sky collide,   
> Throw me over the edge,  
> And let my spirit glide.

Here Browne quickly takes up the major thematic conflict of the album, and just as quickly states his position unequivocally: when stark realities conflict with idealistic aspirations, he seems to be saying, I'll take the idealistic aspirations every time.

The next four lines candidly reveal some of Browne's motivation for such a decision.

> They told me I was going to  
> Have to work for a living,  
> But all I want to do is ride.  
> I don't care where we're going from here,  
> Honey, you decide.

The next verse again takes up the issues of dreams vs. reality.

> Well I spend my time at the  
> Bottom of a wishing well,  
> And I can hear my dreams  
> Singing clear as a bell.  
> I used to know where they ended  
> And the world began,  
> But now it's getting hard to tell:  
> I could be just around the corner from heaven   
> Or a mile from hell.

Here Browne amplifies the depth of his self-knowledge referenced in the first verse, freely admitting that he's not sure he can any longer tell dreams from reality, or whether his pursuit of these dreams is bringing him closer to salvation or damnation. (And an interesting implication of his image, located at the bottom of a well, is that it's one of the few places one can imagine where all you can see is sky.)

But now we finally get to the chorus, and the central image of the song and, perhaps, of the album. Seemingly indicating knowledge of his own shortcomings, the pace of the song slows, with Browne singing in a tone more confessional than boastful, over background cowbell percussion that sounds like the stuttering engine of an aging vehicle that may fail at any moment.

> I'm just rolling away from yesterday,  
> Behind the wheel of a stolen Chevrolet.  
> I'm going to get a little higher,  
> And see if I can hot-wire reality.

Continuing the imagery that ended the first verse, Browne here constructs, in four lines, the ultimate image of rock [liberation][]. Building on the twin legacies of [Chuck Berry][berry] and [Jack Kerouac][kerouac], Browne takes to the road in another automobile, fleeing the past and ready for the future, whatever it may bring, getting a little higher (closer to the sky) as he goes, and fully prepared to encounter reality, commandeer it, and incorporate it in his wild ride.

Now comes the final verse.

> Now can you see those dark clouds gathering up ahead?  
> They're going to wash this planet clean like the Bible said.  
> Now you can hold on steady and try to be ready,  
> But everybody's going to get wet.  
> Don't think it won't happen just because it hasn't happened yet.  

Notice that Browne has here just delivered on the promise made in the chorus. He starts by pointing out, to his listener/companion, the presence of some very real dark clouds occupying the sky ahead. This is, presumably, a chunk of reality. But now, he "hot-wires" that reality: he attaches meaning to it, he builds a story around it, he uses it for his own purpose. And then he ends with words expressing the sentiment of any true visionary, any storyteller: "Don't think it won't happen just because it hasn't happened yet."

One could certainly question whether this song is really the thematic center of the album, since it seems to contradict or at least reduce in significance the dirgeful disillusionment expressed in much of the rest of the album's content. But I view the song this way for several reasons.

* Its placement at the center of the album, at its core, so to speak.
* Its references to the Sky, clearly one of the major symbols used throughout the album.
* Its twin inclusion of both the Chevrolet and the Sky from the album cover.
* Its distance from its subject matter: this is the song that is least dependent on concrete, personal details, and hence most clearly allegorical.
* The breadth of its scope. At its most narrow, the album examines particular characters, at particular points in their own personal cycles of enchantment/disenchantment. Stepping back a little farther, parts of the album look at this cycle as a whole. But this song not only does that, but takes the perspective of the artist, the person writing us these songs and telling us these tales, and examines his role as not only the enchanted, but the enchanter: the person trying to hot-wire reality. Looking at all the perspectives we will find in the album, it is this one that seems the most comprehensive.
