I count this 1974 album from Jackson Browne as one of the greatest artistic achievements in the history of rock music. 

If your evaluation is just based on the album's sales, or on the number of hit singles it generated, or even on the average quality of the individual tracks, then you could easily place it at a mere # 375 on a list of the greatest albums of all time, as did the editors of *Rolling Stone* magazine in their most recent update to list they refer to as "definitive." 

But the album is so much more than any of these individual attributes. 

What Browne accomplished on *Late For the Sky* was to deliver an extended meditation on the cycle of enchantment and disillusionment that is arguably at the center of our human existence, and his examination of this subject ranged from the intensely personal to the broadly cultural. When viewed within this overarching concept, each component of the album takes on heightened meaning, as each piece adds to, and is also enhanced by, the integrity of the whole. 

In order to explain what I mean here, I'd like permission to take you on an in-depth journey through the album. I think I can promise that your understanding of the work will be enhanced by the time spent, but I can also say with some confidence that your understanding of the full potential of rock music -- and perhaps even your understanding of the human condition -- will also be expanded by the journey.
