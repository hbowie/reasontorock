Title:  Track 4: The Late Show

Seq:    10

Level:  2

Body: 

This song closes out the original side one of the album. As such, it's a bit of a place-holder, touching on and carrying forward several of the album's themes and symbols, but deferring any strong resolutions until side two. 

It's also a bit experimental in its construction, with a recurring, often overlapping, vocal chorus, sometimes echoing Browne's words, at other times extending his thoughts. And then there are those percussive door slams at the end of the track. These unusual elements perhaps offer a couple of reasons why Browne has rarely performed this song in his live shows. 

Note that the song title plays with the word "late," but the word and title appear nowhere within the song's lyrics. Today we think of *The Late Show* as a late-night talk show, but back when this song was written -- before cable, before Netflix -- the phrase might have more typically referred to the old black-and-white movies that aired on broadcast television channels during the hours when most people were asleep. 

The singer starts with some general observations and reflections on the difficulty of having close relationships. 

> Everyone I've ever known has wished me well.  
> Anyway that's how it seems, it's hard to tell.  
> Maybe people only ask you how you're doing  
> 'cause that's easier than letting on how little they could care.  
> But when you know that you've got a real friend somewhere,  
> Suddenly all the others are so much easier to bear.  

Now he touches on the tension between the real and the ideal, the difficulty of breaking out of a lonely space, and the inadequacy of words. 

> Now to see things clear, it's hard enough I know;  
> While you're waiting for reality to show --  
> Without dreaming of the perfect love,  
> And holding it so far above,  
> That if you stumbled onto someone real, you'd never know.  
> (you'd never know)  
> You could be with somebody who is lonely too  
> (sometimes it doesn't show)  
> He might be trying to get across to you  
> (words can be so slow)  
> When your own emptiness is all that's getting through,  
> There comes a point when you're not sure why you're still talking:  
> I passed that point long ago.  
> (long ago)  
> I'm so tired of all this circling,  
> And all these glimpses of the end.  
> (you know it's useless to pretend)  
> That's all the voices say:  
> "you'll go right on circling  
> Until you've found some kind of friend".

But now the song turns from generalities towards an encounter with an actual flesh-and-blood person, apparently a woman, in a bar, or at a party.

> I saw you through the laughter and the noise.  
> You were talking with the soldiers and the boys:  
> While they scuffled for your weary smiles,  
> I thought of all the empty miles,  
> And the years that I've spent looking for your eyes.  
> (looking for your eyes)  
> And now I'm sitting here wondering what to say  
> (that you might recognize)  
> Afraid that all these words might scare you away  
> (and break through the disguise)  
> No one ever talks about their feelings anyway,  
> Without dressing them in dreams and laughter --  
> I guess it's just too painful otherwise.  

And now Browne wraps things up by setting an imaginary scene -- both for us, as listeners, and for the woman he has been trying to meet -- a scene that sounds very close to the one pictured on the album cover. 
 
> Look--  
> It's like you're standing in the window  
> Of a house nobody lives in,  
> And I'm sitting in a car across the way.  
> (let's just say)  
> It's an early model Chevrolet  
> (let's just say)  
> It's a warm and windy day,  
> You go and pack your sorrow --   
> The trash man comes tomorrow --  
> Leave it at the curb and we'll just roll away.

And so we have a tidy finish to the song -- a Hollywood ending, if you will -- even if admittedly and intentionally contrived. 

Browne pulls off several neat tricks here, and the song plays a definite role in the construction of the album, and it's moving music being played. On the other hand, the song as a singular work lacks any particular thematic or narrative center, and this may be another reason why it is infrequently heard in live shows, and is rarely served up by streaming services.
