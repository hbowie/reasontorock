Title:  Track 7: Walking Slow

Seq:    13

Level:  2

Body: 

This is a fun, upbeat number: just the thing to give us some casual good times before the more serious closer of [[Track 8: Before the Deluge]]. 

Note that, despite the light tone of the recording, and the slight ambitions of the lyrics, the song is much more than just filler. 

Let's follow along with Browne's journey on this track. 

> Walking slow down the avenue  
> Through my old neighborhood.  
> Don't know why I'm happy --   
> I've got no reason to feel this good.  
> Maybe it's because I'm all alone  
> And I've got no place to go;  
> And everywhere I look I see  
> Another person I'll never know.  
>   
> I got a thing or two to say  
> Before I walk on by:  
> I'm feeling good today.  
> But if die a little farther along,  
> I'm trusting everyone to carry on.  
>   
> Pretty little girl   
> Running up and down the street with no shoes on.  
> I got a pretty little girl of my own at home.  
> Sometimes we forget we love each other  
> And we fight for no reason --    
> I don't know what I'll do if she ever leaves me alone.  
>   
> I got a thing or two to say  
> Before I walk on by:  
> I'm feelin' good today.  
> But if I die a little farther along,  
> I'm trustin' everyone to carry on.  
>   
> I'm puttin' down my left foot.  
> I'm puttin' down my right foot.  
>   
> I got a thing or two to say  
> Before I walk on by:  
> I'm feelin' good today.  
> But if I die a little farther along,  
> I'm trusting everyone to carry on.

This song offers some remarkable balance within the album. Compared to the complex problems and tensions explored in many of the other songs, here Browne seems to be saying, hey, it's alright just to walk down the street with no particular place to go and no companions, and just enjoy yourself. And it's ok to enjoy a simple romantic relationship that has its ups and downs. And it's ok to combine a knowledge of our own mortality with a simple sense that we're part of a human tradition, and the weight of the world is not all ours to bear alone. 

If just viewed by itself, this song is almost a throw-away. But when placed within its rightful context within the album, it performs a vital function, filling out the overall sense of the whole.
