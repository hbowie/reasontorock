As we go through the details of the album, what we will gradually see revealed is an examination of the human cycle of innocence/experience, illusion/disillusionment, enchantment/disenchantment,  birth/death, creation/dissolution. More distinctly, Browne looks at the cycle of attaching meaning to the people, places and events of one's life, and then seeing that meaning fade and disappear. And while much of Browne's earlier work spoke to very personal experiences at specific points within this cycle, and from the interior of this wheel, here Browne expands his scope, looking not only at very concrete, individual experiences along the way, but at the cycle as a whole. In doing so, he manages to evoke, not just a personal sense of the journeys of a handful of specific characters he's painted for us, but the mood of an entire generation at that particular point in time, a generation on its own journey from innocence to experience, painfully trying to transform its own fading illusions into some new sense of meaning. And, finally, Browne talks about nothing less than how this birth/death cycle might apply to the human race as a whole.
