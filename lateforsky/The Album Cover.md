Title:  The Album Cover

Let's first pause lovingly, as the listener should, with a look at the [album cover][cover]. An iTunes graphic, or even a CD cover, barely does it justice. The inspiration for the visual comes from the painting "[L'Empire des Lumi&#232;res][ledl]" by Belgian painter [Ren&#233; Magritte][magritte]. The cover art was created by photographer [Bob Seidemann][seidemann], after Browne showed him a poster of the Magritte painting and asked him for something similar, with an old Chevy in front of a house. The resulting graphic combines light and dark, the intimate glow of a bedroom window with a vast expanse of endless blue sky, an aging auto under a glowing streetlight, a tree with leaves fringed by sunlight. To some extent, the cover contains props that will make their appearances within some of the album's lyrics: the "stolen Chevrolet" from the "The Road and the Sky," the sky referenced in many of the album's songs. To an even greater extent, though, these elements of the cover foreshadow the contrasts and conflicts of the album's thematic content.
