What a beautiful album, what an amazing achievement, what a powerful work of art. 

At the beginning of the sixties, and before, popular music was focused on individual songs and individual tracks: hit singles, if you will. 

As rock artists grew in artistic maturity in the latter half of the sixties, they began to conceive of their albums as artistic wholes, rather than a few hit singles accompanied by enough filler to pad out an LP. 

Many of these albums relied on a consistent sound and approach to the music as their unifying elements: think of The Beatles' *Revolver*.

Others relied on a consistent sound and a consistent approach to their lyrics and selection of subject matter: think of *Beggar's Banquet* by The Rolling Stones, or *Blonde on Blonde* by Bob Dylan. 

A few artists tried to create albums as "rock operas," with some limited success. 

What very few ever accomplished, though, was to create an album such as *Late for the Sky*, in which the individual tracks don't just feel like they belong together, but actually fit together to make a lyrical whole greater than the sum of its parts. 

I think Springsteen got it right when he referred to this album as a "masterpiece," and Stephen Holden got it right in his original review of this album for *Rolling Stone* when he referred to Browne's "lyric genius."  If later pop revisionism somehow decided that the tunes weren't catchy enough, the lyrics required too much thought, or the sales figures weren't impressive enough, then I think the fault is more in the ears and minds of the critics than in the material itself.

This album is a touchstone for me. A framed print of Bob Seidemann's cover art hangs in my living room. I have many songs I love, many recordings of those songs, many albums. And I return to these, not just out of familiarity, or to use as background music, but because they provide me with a deep sense of meaning about the life I have lived, the life I am still living, and the lives of those around me. But even among these pieces of art, this album stands out for me, as the most unified and coherent and meaningful album in my collection.

I hope you find as much joy and meaning in it as I do.
