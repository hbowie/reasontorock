Title:  Track 2: Fountain of Sorrow

Seq:    8

Level:  2

Body: 

After starting by taking us with him to a very specific point in the arc of a failing relationship, Browne now looks back on this or another relationship from a greater philosophical distance, alternately contrasting earlier feelings with later apprehensions. 

Let's see how he starts.

> Looking through some photographs 
> I found inside a drawer,  
> I was taken by a photograph of you.  
> There were one or two I know that.  
> You would have liked a little more,  
> But they didn't show your spirit quite as true.
> 
> You were turning 'round to see who was behind you;  
> And I took your childish laughter by surprise;  
> And at the moment that my camera happened to find you,  
> There was just a trace of sorrow in your eyes.

We start with a drawer full of old photos: flat images capturing moments from the past. But then, instead of the photographer taking the pictures, he is taken by one of his photos, one that is more than just a two-dimensional image, but captures some inner spirit of its subject, the person being addressed by the singer. And although the photo takes the subject by surprise, with childish laughter coming from her mouth, there is also a wisp of sadness in her eyes. 

Note already all the opposing tensions introduced in this so far very simple story of photos being taken: appearance vs. substance, observer vs. observed, artifice vs. reality, forward vs. backwards, past vs. present, innocence vs. experience, childhood vs. adulthood, joy vs. sorrow. 

> Now the things that I remember  
> Seem so distant and so small,  
> Though it hasn't really  
> Been that long a time.  
> What I was seeing wasn't   
> What was happening at all,  
> Although for a while   
> Our path did seem to climb.
>
> When you see through love's illusions,  
> There lies the danger;  
> And your perfect lover   
> Just looks like a perfect fool:    
> So you go running off   
> In search of a perfect stranger,  
> While the loneliness seems to  
> Spring from your life,  
> Like a fountain from a pool.

Now the singer focuses more specifically on illusion vs. reality. He acknowledges that what he once thought he was seeing between the two of them wasn't real. But then he talks about the danger of seeing through love's illusions, turning a perfect lover into a perfect fool, and causing the singer to chase after a perfect stranger, evoking three very different sorts of perfection, and perhaps suggesting that the idea of perfection is itself illusory. And then he introduces the image from the song's title, of a fountain of sorrow, bringing a constant flow of loneliness to the surface from some deep wellspring below. 

But now, having acknowledged the existence of this fountain, Browne begins to reconcile the song's contrasting opposites. 

> Fountain of sorrow,  
> Fountain of light.  
> You've known that hollow sound  
> Of your own steps in flight.  
> You've had to hide sometimes,  
> But now you're all right.  
> And it's good to see  
> Your smiling face tonight.

The fountain now becomes a source of light as well as sorrow, and the singer's subject is now out of hiding and smiling, and the singer and his subject are happily reunited. 

Browne now delivers a clear-eyed assessment of their situation. 

> Now for you and me it may not be,  
> That hard to reach our dreams.  
> But that magic feeling never seems to last.  
> And while the future's there for anyone to change,   
> Still you know it seems...  
> It would be easier sometimes  
> To change the past.

Here Browne steps back from any particular player in the drama, or any particular act in the play, and instead gives us a view of the cycle as a whole: innocence/experience, illusion/disillusionment, freedom/entrapment.

Now Browne looks at his own situation, realizing he is on a path of growing awareness and wisdom. 

> I'm just one or two years and a couple of changes behind you,  
> In my lessons at love's pain and heartache school --  
> Where if you feel too free  
> And you need something to remind you,  
> There's this loneliness  
> Springing up from your life,  
> Like a fountain from a pool.

Now he repeats his earlier lines, again joining this image of a fountain of sorrow to the present joyous connection between singer and subject.

> Fountain of sorrow,  
> Fountain of light:  
> You've known that hollow sound   
> Of your own steps in flight.  
> You've had to hide sometimes,   
> But now you're all right,  
> And it's good to see   
> Your smiling face tonight.

Now the music slows almost to a stop, with just piano and bass playing slowly, as if bringing the song to a close. But then, just when we think it might be over, the other musicians join in again.

Now we have the chorus repeated, but with additional words.

> Fountain of sorrow,   
> Fountain of light:  
> You've known that hollow sound   
> Oof your own steps in flight.  
> You've had to struggle,   
> You've had to fight,  
> To keep understanding   
> And compassion in sight.  
> You could be laughing at me,   
> You've got the right,  
> But you go on smiling,   
> So clear and so bright...!

The music here is warm, buoyant and radiant as Browne sings the final words of joy and reconciliation, of warmth and connection and acceptance.
