Title:  Track 3: Farther On

Seq:    9

Level:  2

Body: 

This is a beautiful, contemplative song featuring some piercingly sweet guitar work from David Lindley. 

Browne starts by reflecting on a lonely childhood filled with fantasies. 

> In my early years I hid my tears  
> And passed my days alone.  
> Adrift on an ocean of loneliness,  
> My dreams like nets were thrown,  
> To catch the love that I'd heard of   
> In books and films and songs:    
> Now there's a world of illusion and fantasy  
> In the place where the real world belongs.  

But, interestingly, Browne the adult is not trying to distance himself from this past, but instead is seemingly embracing it as part of his current self. 

> Still I look for the beauty in songs  
> To fill my head and lead me on,  
> Though my dreams have come up torn and empty,  
> As many times as love has come and gone.  

Now he reflects on those with whom he shared his dreams and schemes, acknowledging the impracticality of his visions. 

> To those gentle ones my memory runs,  
> To the laughter we shared at the meals.  
> I filled their kitchens and living rooms  
> With my schemes and my broken wheels.  
> It was never clear how far or near  
> The gates to my citadel lay;  
> They were cutting from stone some dreams of their own  
> But they listened to mine anyway.  

And now, a rather startling admission from a highly articulate wordsmith:

> I'm not sure what I'm trying to say.  
> It could be I've lost my way:    
> Though I keep a watch over the distance,  
> Heaven's no closer than it was yesterday.  

And now a beautifully poetic word painting in which Browne acknowledges that the angels are older, and yet he is still accompanied by them, rather than flesh and blood human beings. 

> And the angels are older:  
> They know not to wait up for the sun.  
> They look over my shoulder  
> At the maps and the drawings of the journey I've begun.  

And now we learn that Browne, despite his self-knowledge gained by reflecting on his past, is still pursuing a vision in the distance.

> Now the distance leads me farther on,  
> Though the reasons I once had are gone.  
> I keep thinking I'll find what I'm looking for  
> In the sand beneath the dawn.  

And now we conclude with Browne firmly committed to continuing the pursuit of his beautiful visions, still moving farther on. 

> But the angels are older  
> They can see that the sun's setting fast  
> They look over my shoulder  
> At the vision of paradise contained in the light of the past  
> And they lay down behind me  
> To sleep beside the road till the morning has come  
> Where they know they will find me  
> With my maps and my faith in the distance  
> Moving farther on.

This is a remarkable song because, unlike most works contrasting youthful innocence vs. age and experience, this is not a story of disillusionment: quite to the contrary, it is a firm commitment to continuing illusion, to a continued pursuit of what I would call *enchantment*. Despite the evident tension between dreams and reality, Browne here admits that he has no intention of settling for mere reality, no matter how many times his dreams have come up torn and empty, and no matter how much older the angels seem to be.
