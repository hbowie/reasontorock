Title:  Track 8: Before the Deluge

Seq:    14

Level:  2

Body: 

This is the closing song of the album, the track that Browne leaves us with. 

This is a complex piece thematically. Rather than commenting on one section at a time, let's just start by looking at the lyrics as a whole (accompanied by the music, of course). 

> Some of them were dreamers,  
> And some of them were fools,  
> Who were making plans and thinking of the future.  
> With the energy of the innocent,  
> They were gathering the tools  
> They would need to make their journey back to nature.  
>   
> While the sand slipped through the opening,  
> And their hands reached for the golden ring,  
> When their hearts they turned to each other's hearts for refuge  
> In the troubled years that came before the deluge.  
>   
> Some of them knew pleasure,  
> And some of them knew pain,  
> And for some of them it was only the moment that mattered.  
> And on the brave and crazy wings of youth  
> They went flying around in the rain,  
> And their feathers, once so fine, grew torn and tattered.  
>   
> And in the end they traded their tired wings  
> For the resignation that living brings  
> And exchanged love's bright and fragile glow  
> For the glitter and the rouge  
> And in a moment they were swept before the deluge.  
>   
> Let the music keep our spirits high...  
> Let the buildings keep our children dry,  
> Let creation reveal its secrets by and by, by and by,  
> When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky.  
>   
> Some of them were angry  
> At the way the earth was abused  
> By the men who learned how to forge her beauty into power.  
> And they struggled to protect her from them  
> Only to be confused  
> By the magnitude of her fury in the final hour.  
>   
> And when the sand was gone and the time arrived  
> In the naked dawn only a few survived.  
> And in attempts to understand a thing so simple and so huge,  
> Believed that they were meant to live after the deluge.  
>   
> Let the music keep our spirits high,  
> Let the buildings keep our children dry,  
> Let creation reveal its secrets by and by, by and by,  
> When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky.

So what can we observe about this song?

First, note that it seems to spell out in detail an event first alluded to in the closing of [[Track 5: The Road and the Sky]]. 

Next, we can note that the events in the song spell out a sort of allegory that parallels, in action and feeling, much of what happened to Browne's generation in the late sixties and early seventies. So while Browne doesn't speak of specific events, his story outlines the overall arc of youthful consciousness during this period: a desire to experience a simpler, more holistic, relationship with nature; anger at the military-industrial complex; hopeful innocence followed by resignation and disillusionment; a naÃ¯ve spreading of wings with insufficient concern for future consequences. 

Browne's accomplishment here is hard to overstate: he's not just recounting facts and dates, he's not telling us what happened to specific people -- rather, he's singing us a tale that allows us to feel intensely what it was like to live through this period. 

And of course, when listening to Browne's song, it brings to mind other works of narrative fiction that touch on similar themes, such as *Overstory*, the Pulitzer-Prize winning novel by Richard Powers, and *Arcadia*, the novel by Lauren Groff. 

And then, finally, there's the lovely chorus with which the song and album end. 

> Let the music keep our spirits high. 

The first line reminds us of the importance of art and dreams and enchantment. 
  
> Let the buildings keep our children dry.  

The next line reminds us of the importance of practical necessities, as well as the reponsibilities that come once we've outgrown our own childhoods. 

> Let creation reveal its secrets by and by...

The third line reminds us that this state of *not knowing* in which we all live, this experience of mystery, is not a problem to be solved, not a question to be answered, but one of the most profound and enduring elements of our human existence. 

> When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky.

And then this final line returns us to the mystery with which we began our journey: the light and the sky from the album cover, the light lost by the couple in the opening song, "Late for the Sky," the song playing in the singer's ear in "For a Dancer."
