Whereas ??Surrealistic Pillow?? took a couple of weeks to record, ??After Bathing at Baxter's?? took months. Where "White Rabbit" was a brilliantly focused and structured song about expanding your mind through the use of drugs, ??Baxter's?? was a sprawling, diffuse, eclectic, sophisticated work that illustrated the results of such mind expansion. The group takes risks here in all directions at once, seemingly without the slightest fear of artistic or commercial failure, and, even though they seem foolhardy for working without a net, they never slip, and it somehow all seems to work. Musicians, music, words and vocalists all intertwine effortlessly and with superb effect. For a band with only one or two albums under its belt, and under great pressure from audience and industry to extend the commercial success enjoyed by ??Surrealistic Pillow?? and its hit singles, ??Baxter's?? is a singularly brave and admirable effort. 

Some of the better known tracks on this album are "The Ballad of You &amp; Me &amp; Pooneil," "Young Girl Sunday Blues," "Martha," "Wild Tyme," "Rejoyce," "Watch Her Ride" and "Won't You Try/Saturday Afternoon."
