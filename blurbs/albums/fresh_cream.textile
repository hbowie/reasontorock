This was Cream's first album. Producer Pappalardi was not yet working with them, and the band had few original compositions. Most of the songs are reworked blues numbers. Despite these limitations, the album is still a lot of fun, although there is nothing here to indicate what would come later. In retrospect, it is easy to see that at this point they were still a trio of great musicians struggling to find some identity as a band.
