Certainly one of the best Kinks albums in their collection. Here they closely observe a number of elements of modern life. Ray's tone and approach are as varied as his subjects. After a number of albums of carefully crafted pop, they return here to a harder, more abandoned sound reminiscent of their early hits, such as "You Really Got Me." A wonderful album.
