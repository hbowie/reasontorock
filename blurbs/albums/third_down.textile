This was Winchester's second album. Most of the songs are more sparsely produced than on his first, and the songs are often short and apparently simple -- more like sketches in some cases than completed works. But Jesse is in strong voice, the accompaniment is tasteful and supportive, and the songs are almost all gems, featuring beautiful music and interesting, innovative lyrics. A notch below his first album, but still worthwhile.
