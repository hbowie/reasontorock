The focus here is on the group's later material. Classics such as "Surf's Up" and "Long Promised Road" are included, but the second half of the CD includes singles from their final, retro period, such as remakes of Chuck Berry's "Rock and Roll Music" and Buddy Holly's "Peggy Sue." These latter songs have little to recommend them.
