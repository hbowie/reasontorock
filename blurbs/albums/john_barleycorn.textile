This started life as a Winwood solo effort, with Steve playing most of the instruments, then ended up as a collaboration with Wood and Capaldi. This album began what I think of as their later phase, without Dave Mason, and with a more jazzy, meditative feel to the music. Their were only six cuts on the original album, all of them semi-lengthy, with lots of instrumental work. While this is the most consistent of their later albums, and is definitely worth a listen, I tend to prefer their earlier period. There is a sort of emotional barrenness to much of their later work that contrasts starkly with the rich, full emotional range expressed on their earlier albums. And while the early albums sounded collaborative in the best sense, with a group that was much more than just the sum of its parts, the later stuff often sounds like it was conceived and composed by a single mind. Includes the title cut and "Empty Pages."
