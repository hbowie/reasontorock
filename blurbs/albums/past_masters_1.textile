The two ??Past Masters?? volumes collect all their original British singles into two CDs, organized chronologically. Since the album CDs follow the original British packaging model, the Past Masters tracks are not duplicated on the other albums as released on CD. 

While not strictly intended as "greatest hits" compilations, these two volumes contain many of their most popular songs, and are consistently first-rate efforts.
