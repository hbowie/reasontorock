All of the Velvet Underground albums have their particular charms. Their debut has a broader stylistic range than any of the others and -- for that matter -- any other rock album I can think of. Where else can you get finely honed pop gems like "Femme Fatale," a cinema verit&eacute; look at heroin use, a serious song on sado-masochism, electronic feedback and screeching violas -- all on the same album? Warhol's ice-maiden Nico sings three of the songs on the album, giving the album an even broader sound. This is probably the most ground-breaking and promising debut album ever made by a rock group. 

To my ears, however, this first album doesn't stand up over time as well as the later ones. One of the progressions you can see on the four Velvet albums is a continuing revelation of the songwriter as a distinct presence in the songs. On this album, Reed is so intent on accurate and unflinching portrayal of his subjects that he paints himself completely out of the picture. The virtue of this approach is that the he achieves a sort of journalistic objectivity, with no trace of moral sermonizing obscuring our view of his characters. The problem is that there is no sense of the songwriter as a unifying and sympathetic presence. The characters are interesting, but ultimately they should be a lens to let us view the artist himself, and this function is never fulfilled.
