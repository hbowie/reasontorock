His first album contains some of his most accessible music, including "Purple Haze," "Manic Depression," "Hey Joe," "The Wind Cries Mary," "Foxey Lady," "Stone Free" and "Red House." Included are lots of great examples of his innovative guitar work. This is a great first album, a brilliant, brash burst of energy that announced Jimi's arrival to the rock world.
