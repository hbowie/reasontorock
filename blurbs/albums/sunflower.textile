This is my favorite CD among the Beach Boys' various packages. ??Sunflower?? and ??Surf's Up?? are both interesting albums with lots of variety and lots of great music, even if neither is cohesive or consistent enough to be called entirely great. Similar to Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young's ??Deja Vu?? or The Beatles' self-titled "white" album, the varying musical approaches and thematic concerns are widely divergent. "This Whole World," "It's About Time," "Long Promised Road," "Feel Flows" "'Til I Die" and "Surf's Up" are arguably all as good as it gets. Then you have Bruce Johnston's pleasant schmaltz -- "Deirdre," "Tears In The Morning" and "Disney Girls" -- which can either attract or alienate you, depending on your vulnerability to this kind of stuff. Other tracks are clearly not great, but are strange in various interesting ways: "Got To Know The Woman," "Don't Go Near The Water," "Student Demonstration Time" and "A Day In The Life Of A Tree," most notably. The combination of the two CDs makes for an interesting, idiosyncratic and ultimately powerful collection of music.
