This is an excellent compilation of Hendrix' work. It features 20 of his best cuts, including singles and album tracks. Many of his most familiar works from his three completed studio albums, listed separately below, can be heard here, as well as four cuts from a projected fourth album, still in work at the time of his death. The final track is his rendition of "The Star Spangled Banner," from Woodstock.
