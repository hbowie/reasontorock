Rather than the expected masterpiece of ??Smile,?? the group's next album -- an altogether different work called ??Smiley Smile?? -- was mostly significant for its relaxed silliness. ??Wild Honey?? was an attempt to infuse the group's sound with R&B. Includes "Heroes and Villains," "Good Vibrations," " "Wild Honey," "Darlin'" and "Here Comes The Night."
