As mentioned above, this collection garnered lots of FM airplay when it was first released, and served more than any of the band's earlier releases to establish many of the included tracks as familiar classics. This is a great collection, although it is hard to see why, with the additional purchase of only two more CDs, you wouldn't want to own the entire Buffalo Springfield collection.
