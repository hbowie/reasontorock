This is really their best album, and it can stand alongside any rock group's best work. Mason was still recording with them, giving them a broad range of interesting songs along with his distinctive folky vocals, and the group had developed its instrumental abilities to perfectly showcase each unique song. Every cut on here is a classic. Includes "You Can All Join In," "Pearly Queen," "Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring," "Feelin' Alright," "Forty Thousand Headmen," "Cryin' to be Heard" and "No Time to Live." Produced by Jimmy Miller.
