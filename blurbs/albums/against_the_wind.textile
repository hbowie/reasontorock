Another solid effort with some great tracks. Seger got some help from the famed Muscle Shoals band on roughly half of the tracks, with the usual Silver Bullet Band pulling their weight on the rest. Includes the title track, "The Horizontal Bop," "You'll Accomp'ny Me," "Her Strut," "Betty Lou's Gettin' Out Tonight" and "Fire Lake."
