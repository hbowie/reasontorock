One of the greatest rock albums ever made. Every song on here reveals intelligence and depth. An extended meditation on the nature of reality and perception. Varied arrangements, from bare-bone blues to a much fuller sound. Nicky Hopkins adds piano to many of the songs. Great production by Jimmy Miller, with all the vocal and instrumental lines standing out like individual beads of water on a leaf after a spring rain. Includes "Sympathy For The Devil" and "Street Fighting Man."
