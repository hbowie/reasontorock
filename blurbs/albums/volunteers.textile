This was the last great album by the classic lineup, augmented on this recording by keyboardist Nicky Hopkins (who around this time was managing to show up on every other rock album released by better groups on either side of the Atlantic) as well as Jerry Garcia on pedal steel guitar. This is a beautifully balanced and sequenced album, starting and ending with the thematic bookends of "We Can Be Together" and "Volunteers," but also containing: 

* the Airplane's version of "Wooden Ships," co-written by Paul Kantner, David Crosby and Stephen Stills, and also recorded by Crosby, Stills & Nash; 
* "A Song for all Seasons," Spencer Dryden's country-tinged song about the internal problems being experienced by the band;
* "The Farm," the Airplane's song about the bliss of rural retreat, which was becoming __de rigueur__ for rock bands about this time, featuring the immortal lines "Here comes my next door neighbor, coming down the road, he always looks so regal, riding on his toad"; 
* "Good Shepherd," a reworking of a traditional blues song, sung by Jorma, with a wonderful treatment by the entire band; 
* "Hey Frederick," a Grace Slick number fusing modern poetry with psychedelic rock; 
* "Turn My Life Down," a beautiful, bittersweet, thoughtful song by Jorma, with lead vocals by Marty, and backing vocals by the rest of the band, and beautiful lead guitar by Jorma.

This is a wonderful, timeless album, and a fitting testament to the soul of this great group of musicians.
