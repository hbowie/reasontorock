This was the last album recorded by the group. Thankfully, this recording consolidates the strengths of most of the group's later efforts. It manages to preserve the individual characters of the group's members, yet returns to the collaborative work on each song that had always marked their best efforts. Musically, it retains the virtues of patient studio craftsmanship yet relies primarily on the instinctive musicianship of the four Beatles themselves. A great work to go out on. After this, The Beatles split and began separate recording careers.
