This is Dylan's first album that was all electric. The subject matter spans the range of "protest" songs, such as the title tune, and more personal ones, such as "Like A Rolling Stone." The accompanying musicians were given the freedom to accompany Dylan in new and unusual ways. The most famous story is of Al Kooper, who arrived at the sessions planning on playing electric guitar, then switched to organ once he heard Michael Bloomfield's playing on guitar. Kooper's noodlings on organ were immortalized as an essential element of the recording "Like A Rolling Stone," and his impromptu approach was hailed as a fresh new element of rock. 

However they came together, the sessions were magical, and the result is one of Dylan's most lyrically and musically compelling. Absolutely essential.
