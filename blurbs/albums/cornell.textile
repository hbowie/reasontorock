Many of the later Grateful Dead releases were of their live shows. Once the industry transitioned from vinyl to CD, it was feasible to package an entire concert (usually several hours) as a single release, allowing listeners to hear pretty much exactly what the group had played on any particular night. 

When viewed as collections of tracks, these sets all have their ups and downs, both in terms of the quality of the musical performances and as deliveries of compelling songs. However many Dead fans view each of these complete concert recordings as a unified work, and debate the relative merits of one evening's concert compared to another's. 

For those wishing to experience one of these classic concerts, the recently released 3-CD set recorded at Cornell University, on May 8, 1977, in Barton Hall, is considered by many to be one of their finest, and was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2012.
