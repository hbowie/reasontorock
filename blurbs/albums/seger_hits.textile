This is a beautiful package. The songs are all great, cover a broad range of themes, and span the full sweep of Seger's career up through 1994, when the compilation was originally issued. Lyrics, personnel listings, and some personal notes from Seger are included for each song. Photos of Seger and long-time band members, accompanied by their children, are included as well. The whole package, like Seger's music, gives the impression that the listener is a trusted companion. This is a great place to start, and a package worth having even if you acquire a good collection of Seger's other CDs.
