Some claim that this debut album suffers from poor production, but it is still full of energy and lots of great tracks. This is probably the most cohesive album, with all the band members collaborating on every track. Includes "For What It's Worth," "Sit Down I Think I Love You," "Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing," "Flying On The Ground Is Wrong" and "Do I Have To Come Right Out And Say It."
