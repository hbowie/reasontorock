If you have never experienced a live Springsteen show, or want to relive the experience, then this 3-CD set provides as good a simulation as you can get. Recorded over a ten-year span, the material starts with performances at the Roxy, a small club in LA, and then goes on to the big stadium shows. The early material is my favorite, offering a more intimate glimpse of Springsteen than is available now, with the quiet reading of "Thunder Road" being a standout. The collection features a number of personal Springsteen stories either opening or punctuating the songs, showcasing the singer's sense of drama, and offering something not available on the studio recordings. 

The range of material included is everything one could hope for, including songs from all of the major albums mentioned above, as well as additional material, such as a passionate performance of Woody Guthrie's "This Land is Your Land." The best of the ??Nebraska?? material is shoe-horned in as well, even though it makes little use of the E Street Band. 

In general, I prefer the studio recordings of almost all of these songs, so this album is not recommended as a substitute for the other albums, but as a complement to them. Given Springsteen's reputation for heroic live performances, this collection serves admirably as a sampler from those shows.
