This latest Beatles compilation is named __1__ because it contains all of the Beatles singles that hit the top of the charts (depending, of course, on how you count: "Love Me Do" is included, even though it didn't make number 1 on its original release, but did on its rerelease in 1982; "Please Please Me" is not included, even though it hit number 1 on several charts, because it never made it to the top position on the __Record Retailer__ list). 

What the title also means, though, is that this is the Beatles album to buy if you insist on buying only 1. This is a generous collection (almost 80 minutes) of indisputably top-notch rock music, although there are better choices if you want a richer selection of the group's material.
