This is the best album from the Brian Jones era, with his eclectic musical touches all over the best songs on the album. Includes "Paint It Black," "Stupid Girl," "Under My Thumb" and "Lady Jane." Some of these songs have often been called misogynistic, but inappropriately so, I think. "Stupid Girl" and "Under My Thumb" both talk about very particular characters, and make no statements about women in general. Jagger and the Stones were simply willing to be more honest than most, as was often the case.
