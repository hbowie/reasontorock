This is the first album by what would become the classic Airplane line-up, now including Grace Slick and Spencer Dryden. Slick brought two songs with her to the group, one that she had written, "White Rabbit," and one penned by her brother-in-law, Darby Slick, "Somebody to Love." Both became top ten singles. The album contains tremendous variety, including some instrumental finger-picking by Jorma Kaukonen on "Embryonic Journey." Despite being very intentionally experimental, eclectic and psychedelic, there is not a trace of self-indulgence, and the entire album holds up amazingly well, both as a collection of songs and as a unified work. Other tracks included -- almost all of them notable -- are "She Has Funny Cars," "My Best Friend," the achingly beautiful love songs "Today" and "Comin' Back To Me," "3/5 of a Mile in Ten Seconds," "D. C. B. A. - 25," "How Do You Feel," and an amazingly prophetic rant about the electronic media, "Plastic Fantastic Lover."
