The title cut is a 12-minute jam that is hypnotic and entrancing, and is a good example of early rock/jazz fusion. "Hidden Treasure," "Rainmaker" and "Many a Mile to Freedom" are pleasantly folksy, in the vein of "John Barleycorn." "Rock and Roll Stew" and "Light Up or Leave Me Alone" are intended more as rockers, and are the least interesting of the album's offerings. Jim Gordon on drums (from Derek and the Dominos) and Rick Grech on bass (from Blind Faith) fill out the sound.
