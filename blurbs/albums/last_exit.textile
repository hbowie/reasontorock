This album is really surprisingly good, considering that it was thrown together at the last minute to satisfy some contractual commitments. Side one of the original album (the first five cuts) were recorded in the studio, and include some great material. Side two (the last two tracks) were recorded live, with the group performing as a trio. Neither of the live songs are the group's compositions, nor are they any sort of rock or blues standards. They are both longish tracks, with soulful vocals from Winwood and interesting musicianship, especially from Winwood on organ and Wood on flute. The group succeeds fairly well on both of these outings, and these live cuts stand testimony today to the group's extraordinary ambition at the time. Includes "Shanghai Noodle Factory" and "Medicated Goo."
