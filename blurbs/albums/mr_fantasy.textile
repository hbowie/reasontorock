Traffic's first album was released in differing English and American versions, with and without their early singles, and this confusion has carried over into some of the CD editions as well. No matter what it is called -- ??Mr. Fantasy?? or ??Heaven Is In Your Mind?? -- make sure it includes fifteen or sixteen tracks, as both of these recent versions do. Some of the material here is dispensable, but the title cuts and others are classics, and there is lots of good stuff here. Includes "Heaven Is In Your Mind," "No Face, No Name, No Number," "Dear Mr. Fantasy," "Dealer," "Coloured Rain," "Paper Sun," and "Smiling Phases." Produced by Jimmy Miller.
