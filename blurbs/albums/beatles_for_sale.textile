Apparently this album was thrown together quickly in order to get something out in time for the 1964 Christmas season. As a result, it is not as strong as some of their other efforts. There are quite a few covers here, and not all of them are particularly winning. There is more of a Country and Western influence here than on most of their other albums. Still, "I'll Follow The Sun" and the cover of Buddy Holly's song "Words Of Love" are absolutely great, many of the other tracks are good, and there is nothing here that won't grow on you with time.
