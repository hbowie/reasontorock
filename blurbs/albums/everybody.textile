My absolute favorite Kinks album. The Kinks draw heavily on their English music hall roots, featuring a full horn section, including trombone and tuba, as well as the more customary trumpet and saxophone. The songs generally take a look at the lives of performers, including Hollywood stars ("Celluloid Heros") as well as those of the Kinks themselves ("Sitting in My Hotel" and others). Also included is the fabulous "Supersonic Rocket Ship," which is sort of a traditional British answer to American groups like Jefferson Starship, featuring lines like "We're going to travel faster than light, so do up your overcoat tight." Absolutely original and totally unalloyed Kinks.
