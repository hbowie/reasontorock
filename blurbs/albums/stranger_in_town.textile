This could well be Seger's high water mark in terms of complete albums. Great songs, great music, great production, lots of variety, honest, heartfelt lyrics: this one has it all. Includes "Hollywood Nights," "Still The Same," "Old Time Rock &amp; Roll," "Till It Shines," "Feel Like A Number," "We've Got Tonight," "Brave Strangers" and "The Famous Final Scene."
