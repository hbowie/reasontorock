An extraordinarily vigorous and promising debut album. Springsteen's lyrics are imaginative, poetic and often surreal, obviously inspired by Dylan. The playing is energetic and inventive. This album and the next featured Springsteen's original drummer, Vini "Mad Dog" Lopez. While not as predictable as his successor, Max Weinberg, Lopez had a frenetic energy that was probably a better match for the lyric inventiveness found on these early efforts. Includes "Blinded by the Light," "Growin' Up," "Does this Bus Stop at 82nd Street?," "Lost in the Flood," "For You," "Spirit in the Night" and "It's Hard to be a Saint in the City."
