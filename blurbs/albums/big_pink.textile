This debut album by The Band features cover art painted by Bob Dylan, as well as three songs at least partially penned by him. His influence is evident in many of the other songs as well, whose writing credits are shared by Robbie Robertson and Richard Manuel. Also included is a cover version of "The Long Black Veil," a country tune that has an older feel to it.

While the group's second album is sometimes viewed as the group's best, it is easy to make a case for this first collection as well. "Tears of Rage," "The Weight," "This Wheel's On Fire," and "I Shall Be Released" are all essential recordings, and every other song on the album adds to the collection. The lyrics on this album are a bit more adventurous and less literal than on the second, perhaps showing the influence of Dylan. This was a ground-breaking album when first released, and it still stands today as a monumental accomplishment.
