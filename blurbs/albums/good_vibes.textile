This box set has a ton of good music, and is the most extensive compilation available. On the other hand, also included are demo tapes, previously unreleased studio works, backing tracks for obscure songs, and the necessary representation from their later albums -- all of which I, for one, could do without. Perhaps more disappointing are the exclusion of some of the best non-Brian tracks, including "It's About Time" and "Feel Flows," both of which are absolute classics. I would think your money would probably be better spent selecting some of the original albums listed below rather than this, or any of the other, compilations.
