This is a double album that represents Jimi's most experimental and eclectic work. If the first album was a summary of what Jimi had achieved up to that point, and the second album was an indication of new directions he wanted to pursue, this third album is the realization of many of those goals. Each song is an attempt to pursue a new and fresh idea. One of the most daring and innovative albums in all of rock.
