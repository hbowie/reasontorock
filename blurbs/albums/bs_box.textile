For those who simply can't get enough Buffalo Springfield. Lots of demos and alternate versions of songs, alternate mixes of the complete first two albums, but no live songs. (Although the group was supposed to have been spectacular in live performances, the only decent live recording is reputed to be a bootleg, recorded in Dallas on April 20, 1968). But most people will be better off simply owning all three of their originally released albums.
