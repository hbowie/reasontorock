By this point the band had achieved fame for its live shows, resulting in a double album of mostly strange studio work ("Pressed Rat and Warthog" being one such number) on the first disc, coupled with four lengthy live outings on the second. This was also a sort of classic, though, illustrating the full range of the band's work and, by extension, the breadth of ambition possible in rock at the time. As odd a collection as it was, this eagerly anticipated album was one of the biggest sellers of the late sixties. Whatever you think of the quality of the music (I think it is something of a mixed bag), it is hard not to be awed that such astonishing musical diversity could find so large an audience willing to accept its full range.
