The band's inaugural album featured female vocalist Signe Anderson rather than Grace Slick, and drummer Skip Spence rather than Spencer Dryden, so this was not yet the classic line-up that would be preserved over the next five albums. This album features "Let's Get Together," which would become a hit for the Youngbloods, and also includes "It's No Secret," by Marty Balin, and "Come Up the Years," by Balin and Kantner. The rest of the album shows lots of promise, and displays many of the ingredients that would become trademarks for the band, but this is clearly a freshman effort.
