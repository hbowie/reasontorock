Fortunately for listeners, Cream had the sort of career perfectly suited to a boxed set such as this one. All of the group's released studio tracks are included here in their entirety, plus many live performances, some not previously released. In other words, this collection makes all of their other albums unnecessary. This is a wise purchase for anyone interested in more than a single-CD greatest hits collection.
