It's hard to imagine any rational basis for picking this particular selection of recordings as being the group's best. Two of the group's most popular songs, "Sweet Jane" and "Rock & Roll," are included only in live versions, presumably because the studio versions were issued by a different record company. Even if you are somehow firmly convinced you will never buy more than one VU album, you would be better off buying any one of their original releases rather than this collection.
