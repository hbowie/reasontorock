This was recorded at Seger's first headlining appearance at a major hall in his hometown of Detroit, after years of playing in smaller venues. Seger and the Silver Bullet Band are in great form, have something to prove, and prove it beyond all reasonable doubt. This was originally a double album and has a generous collection of 14 tracks. Includes "Nutbush City Limits," "Travelin' Man," "Beautiful Loser," "Jody Girl," "I've Been Working," "Turn The Page," "Ramblin' Gamblin' Man," "Heavy Music," "Katmandu," "Get Out Of Denver" and "Let It Rock."
