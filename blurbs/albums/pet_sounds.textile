The group's masterpiece. Comparable to The Beatles' ??Revolver,?? this was an album full of consistently solid material, possessing a unified group sound, and with lyrics based more on the songwriters' own lives, rather than the lowest common denominator of their audience's expectations. Includes "Wouldn't It Be Nice," "You Still Believe In Me," Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder," "Sloop John B," "God Only Knows," "I Know There's An Answer," "I Just Wasn't Made For These Times" and "Caroline, No."
