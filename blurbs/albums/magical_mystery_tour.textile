This album is a collection of songs written for a British television special, thrown together with the contemporaneous singles from the group, so it doesn't have the conceptual or stylistic integrity of some of the other Beatles' albums. The music generally shares the psychedelic flavor of ??Sgt. Pepper's.?? The album includes a number of great recordings, and almost all are eminently listenable. The Beatles were nothing if not perfectionists.
