Mostly songs about romantic love, and questioning the validity of romantic relationships. In retrospect, given Springsteen's divorce a year after this album was released, this was probably the most autobiographical of his later efforts. Other than this shift in focus, there was nothing radically different about the music. Once again, though, Springsteen earns points for constantly trying something new, never content to simply repeat past successes, artistic or commercial.
