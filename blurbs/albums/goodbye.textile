One last attempt to cash in on the band's reputation, this album attempts to duplicate the live/studio combination on a single disc, but ends up sounding more like a collection of odds and ends thrown together to make a complete album. There is nothing among the live performances here to match the best of their earlier work, and no great psychedelic blues hit among the studio tracks. "Badge," authored and performed with George Harrison, is the most memorable song, and was said by Clapton to be an attempt to retreat from the excess sometimes produced by Cream, and instead to emulate the more cohesive and restrained work of The Band.
