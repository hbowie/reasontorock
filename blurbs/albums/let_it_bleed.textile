An essential companion piece to __Beggar's Banquet.__ The title was a take-off from the Beatles song title, "Let It Be." Whereas __Beggar's Banquet__ was about the Stones looking out at the world, __Let It Bleed__ was more about the world's perception of the Stones. Again produced by Jimmy Miller and again featuring Nicky Hopkins, as well as other guest instrumentalists and vocalists. Includes "You Can't Always Get What You Want," "Midnight Rambler," "Gimme Shelter" and "Let It Bleed."
