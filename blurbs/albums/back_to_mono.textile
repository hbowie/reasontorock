A boxed set containing practically all of Spector's notable work. The original set consisted of 4 CDs, one of them being the complete __Christmas Gift__ album. Amazon's current listing, however, specifies only 3 CDs in the set. While there are a lot of great recordings included here, the cumulative effect is a bit wearing, especially due to the repetition and limitations of many of the lyrics. Included is the shocking title "He Hit Me (It Felt Like A Kiss)." While this is the only song to explicitly describe this sort of abuse, relationships based on female submission and dependence seem to be the dominant subject matter of the songs.
