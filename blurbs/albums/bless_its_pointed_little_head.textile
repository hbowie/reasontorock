This is a live album, notable for inclusion of several of the group's best songs, as well as bearing witness to the group's style and power on stage. The album features consistently great performances by the entire group and shows the full range of the band's concert repertoire, including such gems as "Fat Angel," by Donovan, the traditional blues "Rock Me Baby," "The Other Side of This Life," by folk singer Fred Neil and "Bear Melt," an exercise in group improvisation that stretches out for over eleven minutes. Also included are "3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds," "Somebody to Love," "It's No Secret" and "Plastic Fantastic Lover." The latest CD reissue also includes live versions of "Today," "Watch Her Ride," and "Won't You Try."
