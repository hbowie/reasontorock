This was Springsteen's most popular album, with no less than seven of its twelve tracks becoming Top Ten hits. Springsteen returned to the band format, and to more populist themes. But the combination of straight-ahead rock with tales of alienation yielded fresh contradictions, such as Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign appropriating the "Born in the USA" track as pep rally material, even though a careful listen to the words would have revealed a song about a disenchanted Vietnam veteran. 

These is probably the most universal and accessible set of songs Springsteen has written. The hero of the title tune is a war veteran, so while he is another alienated outsider, he is not a mass murderer, but someone with a story that most Americans could relate to. The other songs have similarly broad appeal. 

Includes "Born in the USA," "Cover Me," "Darlington County," "I'm on Fire," "No Surrender," "Bobby Jean," "Glory Days," "Dancing in the Dark" and "My Hometown."
