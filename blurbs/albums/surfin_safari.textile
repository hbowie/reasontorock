One of the best things about The Beach Boys on CD is that almost all of their albums have been re-released in pairs, with two consecutively released albums on one CD. These are among the best deals available. This CD offers the group's first two albums, on which they consolidate their early Surf sound. Includes "Surfin' Safari," "409" and "Surfin' USA."
