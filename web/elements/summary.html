          <h1 class="accent">Summary</h1>
<p>Although the development of the rock aesthetic happened gradually over a number of years, and included trends begun by other musical genres, the end result was a radically new art form. The lyrics were the foundation. Compared to popular and traditional song forms that preceded rock, the best rock music incorporated a use of language and a breadth of subject matter inherited from the poetic tradition. The expressiveness of the singer&#8217;s voice and the instrumental backing were incorporated into this new kind of poetry, though, adding other means to extend and reinforce the meanings of the words. The ability to precisely record sounds redefined the artistic unit of expression, and allowed styles and influences to transcend regional boundaries. How notes were played or sung began to matter as much or more than the notes themselves. Small ensembles that combined the tightness and spontaneity of their live performances with the thoughtful, deliberate creative potential offered by the recording studio produced recorded sound that offered the best of both avenues of expression. </p>

<p>The following two tables summarize this section in a more systematic way. This first table shows the impact of technical progress on the development of rock music. </p>

Rock music is similar to poetry in that: <br />
&#8226; the words matter, <br />
&#8226; the meaning is compact, <br />
&#8226; most works are relatively short, <br />
&#8226; they both have broad ranges of subject matter and theme, and <br />
&#8226; they use rhythm to add power to their expression. <br />

Styles and techniques of prior popular music developed by region, since these were passed on primarily through live performances. For rock music, however, styles and influences transcended geographical regions, since they were passed on through recordings. This offered rock musicians broader stylistic palettes, resulting in greater eclecticism. (See &#8220;<a href="records_in.html">Recordings as Input to the Creative Process</a>.&#8221;

Classical Music
</td>
<td class="shadedCentered">
&lt;&gt; 
</td>
<td class="shaded">
In classical music, and in European music in general, the composition is the primary work of art, and performance is a matter of interpreting the work. In rock music, however, a specific performance, as recorded, edited and published, is the primary work of art, and the composition is only one element of the finished work. In this sense, rock is to European music exactly as film is to theatre: in both of the earlier forms, the work of art was the composition as recorded on paper; in the later forms, the work of art was the edited performance as recorded on some more direct medium.
