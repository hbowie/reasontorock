        <p>The table below summarizes, in chronological order, the major technological advances that influenced the development of rock music. As we will see, one or more of these technological developments were key enablers for almost every element of rock music. As with most, if not all, artistic movements, it was new technology that created the possibility for a new art form to emerge. </p>

            Multitrack tape recording allowed voices and instruments to be recorded on separate tracks, allowing each to be separately altered, prior to being mixed down into the final two stereo tracks.

            US Federal Communications Commission imposes a non-duplication rule for FM radio stations.</td>
          <td class="shaded">
            This new rule prevented owners of FM radio stations from broadcasting a duplication of programming already available on another AM station. Many owners responded by quickly creating music programs in which the disk jockeys were allowed to play whatever music they wanted, thus creating a radio outlet for album cuts that were otherwise too long or too "uncommercial" to have ever allowed them to be aired on radio. FM radio became a popular distribution channel for rock music, which offered increased sound quality and stereo reproduction when compared the AM radio.</td>
