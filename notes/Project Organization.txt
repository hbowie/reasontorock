The Reason to Rock project is stored on my local Mac, in the Sites folder, as reasontorock.

Note that PSTextMerge is used to create the web site from a series of lists, templates and content files.

The project contains the following files and folders:

* factory -- Various templates used as input by PSTextMerge.

* home -- A Notenik collection used to generate the site home page from a template.

* html -- HTML files to be included in complete pages.

* includes -- BBEdit persistent include files used to update the PSTextMerge templates.

* lists -- Lists of various types of content to be included on the site.

* notes -- Notenik notes about the project.

* scripts -- sitegen.tcz is the primary script used by PSTextMerge to generate the finished site.

* sidebars -- Sidebar code generated for inclusion on each page,

* web -- The actual web site to be uploaded via FTP to the web server. Much of this content is generated by PSTextMerge.
