<p>The two <cite>Past Masters</cite> volumes collect all their original British singles into two CDs, organized chronologically. Since the album CDs follow the original British packaging model, the Past Masters tracks are not duplicated on the other albums as released on CD. </p>

<p>While not strictly intended as &#8220;greatest hits&#8221; compilations, these two volumes contain many of their most popular songs, and are consistently first-rate efforts. </p>

<p>This latest Beatles compilation is named <i>1</i> because it contains all of the Beatles singles that hit the top of the charts (depending, of course, on how you count: &#8220;Love Me Do&#8221; is included, even though it didn&#8217;t make number 1 on its original release, but did on its rerelease in 1982; &#8220;Please Please Me&#8221; is not included, even though it hit number 1 on several charts, because it never made it to the top position on the <i>Record Retailer</i> list). </p>

<p>What the title also means, though, is that this is the Beatles album to buy if you insist on buying only 1. This is a generous collection (almost 80 minutes) of indisputably top-notch rock music, although there are better choices if you want a richer selection of the group&#8217;s material. </p>

<p>This is The Beatles&#8217; first album, recorded in a single marathon 24-hour session in the studio. If Lennon&#8217;s vocal on &#8220;Twist and Shout&#8221; sounds a bit strained, then this is not mere affectation, but the natural result of George Martin intentionally leaving this song to be recorded last. This album contains a mixture of great cover versions and Beatles originals. The Beatles&#8217; live act originally became popular based on the success of their cover versions, and you can hear why on these early albums: the selections of songs are impeccable and eclectic, and The Beatles demonstrate a thorough mastery of their early influences while at the same time adding their own stylistic touches. </p>

<p>Although only about half of this album is original material, and that half excludes their biggest early hits, this is still a wonderful collection. The cover versions here are terrific: &#8220;Please Mister Postman,&#8221; &#8220;Roll over Beethoven,&#8221; &#8220;You&#8217;ve Really Got a Hold on Me,&#8221; and &#8220;Money&#8221; are all great songs and great recordings, as well as invaluable for tracing the early influences on The Beatles. The covered songs were all staples in their live shows of the time, and show just how good a band The Beatles were, even before they began writing and recording their own material. The self-penned tunes are also good and varied. </p>

<p>This is their first album on which all the songs were penned by The Beatles. This is also the first album on which the songs begin to sound like more than hasty recordings of their live performances (as good as those were). Lennon and McCartney&#8217;s songwriting skills were beginning to mature by this time. </p>

<p>Apparently this album was thrown together quickly in order to get something out in time for the 1964 Christmas season. As a result, it is not as strong as some of their other efforts. There are quite a few covers here, and not all of them are particularly winning. There is more of a Country and Western influence here than on most of their other albums. Still, &#8220;I&#8217;ll Follow The Sun&#8221; and the cover of Buddy Holly&#8217;s song &#8220;Words Of Love&#8221; are absolutely great, many of the other tracks are good, and there is nothing here that won&#8217;t grow on you with time. </p>

<p>This album includes several essential recordings &#8212; the title tune, &#8220;Ticket To Ride,&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ve Just Seen A Face&#8221; and &#8220;Yesterday&#8221; &#8212; and the rest of the album is all very listenable as well. </p>

<p>This album marks a real turning point in The Beatles&#8217; career. This is the juncture at which the group began to feel more comfortable in the studio, allowing themselves to experiment with different instruments and sounds, moving away from simply recording their live shows. This more deliberate creation in the studio is reflected in the quality of the music, which is uniformly excellent. This is also the first album on which their lyrics began to wander outside of the narrow pop sensibilities that had taken them this far. The songs about relationships became more personal and detailed, while songs on other subjects, like &#8220;Nowhere Man&#8221; and &#8220;The Word&#8221; began to appear. The Beatles would continue to evolve past this point, but arguably they would produce no richer or more rewarding rock music than is available on this collection. </p>

<p>This is very much a companion piece to <cite>Rubber Soul</cite> and shares most of its generous virtues. Another dazzling collection by arguably the premier rock group working at the peak of its creative powers. </p>

<p>This album is an unparalleled achievement in rock music. The rich orchestral layers added to The Beatles&#8217; instrumentation, the sophistication of the lyrics, the intensity of the work done in the recording studio, the musical and thematic cohesion of the album as a whole, and the overall themes of altered states of perception and consciousness all mark this as a singular, monumental achievement. The release of this album set a high-water mark for rock artistry, based if nothing else on the sheer amount of labor that obviously went into recording the work. Whereas even the best rock up to this point had always suffered by being viewed as derivative, imitative, unoriginal, commercial and recreational, <cite>Sgt. Pepper&#8217;s</cite> was clearly intended to be an aesthetic endeavor, and the first and most lasting effect it had on its audience was due primarily to the sheer extent of its ambition. </p>

<p>Having said all this, it is important also to note that the album has some significant flaws. The natural appeal of much of the group&#8217;s earlier music was often lost in the vast musical arrangements of the songs, which in retrospect can seem somewhat ponderous. While earlier efforts, no matter how long they were labored over in the studio, had the virtues of seeming relaxed and natural, much of this album seems forced and affected. </p>

<p>Even The Beatles seemed to view <cite>Sgt. Pepper&#8217;s</cite> as the end of a certain evolutionary path, and later efforts would see them intentionally regressing in some ways in order to get back to a more natural and simpler connection with their music. </p>

<p>Yet this album still stands today as a monument to the possibilities of the art form. In retrospect, the album&#8217;s chief failing may be that it was too obvious and extreme in its reliance on artifice that could only be produced at great effort in the recording studio. At the same time, though, this was also the album&#8217;s greatest achievement, in that it made listeners, journalists and critics aware that rock music could indeed be an intentional creative act, and not merely a sometimes inventive popular pastime. </p>

<p>This album is a collection of songs written for a British television special, thrown together with the contemporaneous singles from the group, so it doesn&#8217;t have the conceptual or stylistic integrity of some of the other Beatles&#8217; albums. The music generally shares the psychedelic flavor of ??Sgt. Pepper&#8217;s.?? The album includes a number of great recordings, and almost all are eminently listenable. The Beatles were nothing if not perfectionists. </p>

<p>In their quest for a path forward that retreated somewhat from their more ambitious studio efforts, The Beatles produced this double album that began to treat band members more as individual artists, rather than components of an integrated group. This was perfectly consistent with a maturing audience and emerging rock journalism that began to see individual idiosyncrasies as essential elements of an enduring art form that took itself seriously. This double album contains some of the group&#8217;s most eccentric pieces, such as &#8220;Revolution 9,&#8221; that defy expectations of beautiful compositions, low-key lyrics and smooth vocals. Whereas earlier albums achieved balance by combining the group&#8217;s talents on individual tracks, this larger effort achieves a similar balance only when considered as a whole, with individual tracks betraying more individual authorship. Having said all this, the album still succeeds on its own terms and contains lots of great recordings. </p>

<p>This was the last album recorded by the group. Thankfully, this recording consolidates the strengths of most of the group&#8217;s later efforts. It manages to preserve the individual characters of the group&#8217;s members, yet returns to the collaborative work on each song that had always marked their best efforts. Musically, it retains the virtues of patient studio craftsmanship yet relies primarily on the instinctive musicianship of the four Beatles themselves. A great work to go out on. After this, The Beatles split and began separate recording careers. </p>
