<p>This is an attractively packaged sampler of Winchester&#8217;s work, but skips some of his early classics to make room for greater representation from his later albums. The <cite>Anthology,</cite> listed above, is a better compilation.</p>

<p>This attractively priced two-CD set includes the entire contents of Jesse&#8217;s first album, most of the best songs from his second, plus a sampling of tracks from his later releases. Hard to go wrong here. </p>

<p>Winchester&#8217;s self-titled debut still seems as fresh, perfect and balanced today as it did when first released. With Robbie Robertson of <a href="band.html">The Band</a> producing and playing guitar, accompanied by fellow Band-mate Levon Helm on drums and a whole host of excellent Canadian musicians, the accompaniment is first-rate. As a collection of songs, the album is still nearly without peer. Winchester covers all the bases here, with songs about God, sin, good times, casual attraction, and the fragility of love all fitting comfortably together, achieving an effortless thematic cohesion that more pretentious &#8220;concept&#8221; albums of the day could only strain for. From the dark and brooding &#8220;Black Dog&#8221; to the comic depiction of a Southerner facing the onset of a Canadian winter in &#8220;Snow,&#8221; nearly every song is a classic. And while many of these works achieved greater commercial success for the better-known singers who later recorded them, Winchester&#8217;s own singing on this album is remarkably strong, versatile and attractive, with unmatched intelligence and understanding gracing every interpretation. </p>

<p>This was Winchester&#8217;s second album. Most of the songs are more sparsely produced than on his first, and the songs are often short and apparently simple &#8212; more like sketches in some cases than completed works. But Jesse is in strong voice, the accompaniment is tasteful and supportive, and the songs are almost all gems, featuring beautiful music and interesting, innovative lyrics. A notch below his first album, but still worthwhile.</p>
