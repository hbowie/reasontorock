<p>This is a beautiful package. The songs are all great, cover a broad range of themes, and span the full sweep of Seger&#8217;s career up through 1994, when the compilation was originally issued. Lyrics, personnel listings, and some personal notes from Seger are included for each song. Photos of Seger and long-time band members, accompanied by their children, are included as well. The whole package, like Seger&#8217;s music, gives the impression that the listener is a trusted companion. This is a great place to start, and a package worth having even if you acquire a good collection of Seger&#8217;s other CDs.</p>

<p>This was recorded at Seger&#8217;s first headlining appearance at a major hall in his hometown of Detroit, after years of playing in smaller venues. Seger and the Silver Bullet Band are in great form, have something to prove, and prove it beyond all reasonable doubt. This was originally a double album and has a generous collection of 14 tracks. Includes &#8220;Nutbush City Limits,&#8221; &#8220;Travelin&#8217; Man,&#8221; &#8220;Beautiful Loser,&#8221; &#8220;Jody Girl,&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ve Been Working,&#8221; &#8220;Turn The Page,&#8221; &#8220;Ramblin&#8217; Gamblin&#8217; Man,&#8221; &#8220;Heavy Music,&#8221; &#8220;Katmandu,&#8221; &#8220;Get Out Of Denver&#8221; and &#8220;Let It Rock.&#8221; </p>

<p>This could well be Seger&#8217;s high water mark in terms of complete albums. Great songs, great music, great production, lots of variety, honest, heartfelt lyrics: this one has it all. Includes &#8220;Hollywood Nights,&#8221; &#8220;Still The Same,&#8221; &#8220;Old Time Rock &amp; Roll,&#8221; &#8220;Till It Shines,&#8221; &#8220;Feel Like A Number,&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;ve Got Tonight,&#8221; &#8220;Brave Strangers&#8221; and &#8220;The Famous Final Scene.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another solid effort with some great tracks. Seger got some help from the famed Muscle Shoals band on roughly half of the tracks, with the usual Silver Bullet Band pulling their weight on the rest. Includes the title track, &#8220;The Horizontal Bop,&#8221; &#8220;You&#8217;ll Accomp&#8217;ny Me,&#8221; &#8220;Her Strut,&#8221; &#8220;Betty Lou&#8217;s Gettin&#8217; Out Tonight&#8221; and &#8220;Fire Lake.&#8221; </p>

<p>This is another live album, containing great performances, 16 tracks, and most of his best-known songs released since <cite>Live Bullet</cite>.</p>

<p>The title track has been over-exposed due to its use by Chevrolet in its commercials for years now, but it is still one of Seger&#8217;s best. The rest of the album is a little uninspired compared to previous efforts. </p>

<p>This is Seger&#8217;s latest effort, and he seems to struggle a bit for subject matter that he can inject with the same emotional intensity as his earlier efforts. </p>
