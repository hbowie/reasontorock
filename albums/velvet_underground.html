<p>A comprehensive 5-CD collection that includes essentially all of the band&#8217;s originally released music, plus a generous collection of demos, live recordings, and studio recordings not released on any of the original four albums. Four of the five CDs contain the original VU albums in their original running orders, so that this collection almost renders the separate albums unnecessary. I say &#8220;almost&#8221; because there are a few differences: the self-titled third album is represented by the so-called &#8220;closet mix&#8221; of this album, and the classic &#8220;Sweet Jane&#8221; is included in its original, longer version. In the case of the <cite>VU</cite> album, I think the owner of this compilation gets the better deal. One of the best songs on the album, &#8220;Some Kinda Love,&#8221; is actually a completely different &#8212; and much better &#8212; recording than the one on the currently available stand-alone CD. In general, the closet mix has the vocals featured more prominently, which makes for a more intimate feel that seems closer to the spirit of many of the songs. Also, the closet mix is the collection that was originally released on vinyl. Some listeners have criticized these versions for sounding muffled (as if recorded in a closet), but this doesn&#8217;t seem much of an issue to me. </p>
<p>&#8220;Sweet Jane&#8221; is a different story. At the time <cite>Loaded</cite> was being prepared for its original release, record company officials decided to edit out a portion of the song. Twenty-five years later, the full original version was released on this compilation. There are two problems with the longer version: 1) after so many years of hearing the shorter version, the longer version just sounds <i>wrong</i>; 2) rock musicians sometimes need good editors as much as novelists, and this seems to be one of those cases &#8212; to my ears, the song works better without the omitted portion, which seems to do nothing except slow the pace of the song just when it is reaching its climax on the shorter version. There is recorded evidence that the song evolved radically for some period before being captured in the studio, so there is little justification for viewing the edited segment as an essential missing piece. </p>
<p>Bottom line: this boxed set is well worth the investment, and in one package will get you all the Velvet Underground music most of us will ever need. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine any rational basis for picking this particular selection of recordings as being the group&#8217;s best. Two of the group&#8217;s most popular songs, &#8220;Sweet Jane&#8221; and &#8220;Rock & Roll,&#8221; are included only in live versions, presumably because the studio versions were issued by a different record company. Even if you are somehow firmly convinced you will never buy more than one VU album, you would be better off buying any one of their original releases rather than this collection.</p>

<p>All of the Velvet Underground albums have their particular charms. Their debut has a broader stylistic range than any of the others and &#8212; for that matter &#8212; any other rock album I can think of. Where else can you get finely honed pop gems like &#8220;Femme Fatale,&#8221; a cinema verit&eacute; look at heroin use, a serious song on sado-masochism, electronic feedback and screeching violas &#8212; all on the same album? Warhol&#8217;s ice-maiden Nico sings three of the songs on the album, giving the album an even broader sound. This is probably the most ground-breaking and promising debut album ever made by a rock group. </p>
<p>To my ears, however, this first album doesn&#8217;t stand up over time as well as the later ones. One of the progressions you can see on the four Velvet albums is a continuing revelation of the songwriter as a distinct presence in the songs. On this album, Reed is so intent on accurate and unflinching portrayal of his subjects that he paints himself completely out of the picture. The virtue of this approach is that the he achieves a sort of journalistic objectivity, with no trace of moral sermonizing obscuring our view of his characters. The problem is that there is no sense of the songwriter as a unifying and sympathetic presence. The characters are interesting, but ultimately they should be a lens to let us view the artist himself, and this function is never fulfilled. </p>

<p>The sheer intensity of the noise on this album inspired no end of seventies groups, but the Velvets probably did it better, using feedback and intentional distortion as artistic devices, and not as ends in themselves. If you like this approach, then this album will earn a relic-like place in your collection. If you prefer more approachable and conventional music, then this is the last album to explore. </p>

<p>Let me begin by admitting that the longest song on this album, &#8220;Murder Mystery&#8221; clocking in at 8:53, is at best an interesting but failed experiment. The song contains two different narratives set to verse that are read simultaneously by Reed and Morrison, with each getting its own stereo channel. This is one case where the lyrics prove truly unintelligible and ultimately irrelevant. The best you can say about this track is that is at least listenable, but it doesn&#8217;t really add any value to the album.</p>
<p>With this single exception, however, this is truly one of the best collections of tracks in the entire rock canon. In a complete about-face from their prior album, the music on this album is quiet and understated. There are various interesting explanations for this: John Cale had left the group by this time, taking his screechy viola and avant-garde musical tendencies with him; Morrison and Reed had just bought twelve-string guitars, with which they were enamored; their electric instruments were all stolen just before the beginning of the recording sessions &#8212; and some of these explanations are undoubtedly actually true. Whatever the causes, though, the results are haunting and timeless. </p>
<p>Reed has said of the Velvets&#8217; music that &#8220;... we were always writing on a one-to-one level. So if you listen to the record, it&#8217;s like somebody sitting across from you.&#8221; (<a href="../closing/bibliography.html#fricke">Fricke 1995</a>) Nowhere is this description more apt than with this album. The characters on this collection are as interesting as on earlier efforts, but now there is a lens through which we view them. &#8220;Some Kinda Love&#8221; includes lines like &#8220;Put jelly on your shoulder, baby, lie down upon the carpet.&#8221; But these are now combined with other lines that make some sort of perspective on all this clear: &#8220;Between thought and expression, lies a lifetime,&#8221; and &#8220;No kinds of love are better than others.&#8221; This same song includes a sinuous guitar riff that, like sex itself, is endlessly repeated, but with infinite variations and shadings. </p>
<p>Another masterpiece is &#8220;Beginning to See the Light,&#8221; which alternates serious lines about a relationship like &#8220;Here we go again, thought that you were my friend,&#8221; with others like &#8220;There are problems in these times: oooh, but none of them are mine.&#8221; What&#8217;s great about this song is that the music for both subjects is entirely appropriate, and that these different subjects are contained and embraced within a single song. &#8220;Pale Blue Eyes&#8221; is another great one, with lines like &#8220;If I could make the world as pure / and strange as what I see / I&#8217;d put you in the mirror / I put in front of me / ...linger on / your pale blue eyes.&#8221; Again, the music perfectly echoes the lyrics, with the word &#8220;on&#8221; stretching out while guitars play beautifully in the background, perfectly conveying the image of this timeless, transcendent moment. Lou Reed once recalled that Syracuse University&#8217;s resident poet, Delmore Schwartz, advised him that he could do worse with his life than to devote it to reading James Joyce. (<a href="../closing/bibliography.html#fricke">Fricke 1995</a>) Like Joyce, the Velvets created a world so full of its own strange beauty that at moments like this it seems inhabitable: an alternate universe available at the touch of a button. </p>

<p>This is probably the group&#8217;s most approachable and conventional record. They had signed with a new record company, and were actually being urged to write songs that could conceivably be played on a radio station. While the band had broken up by the time the album was released, the attempt was ultimately successful. Two of the tracks on here, &#8220;Sweet Jane&#8221; and &#8220;Rock & Roll,&#8221; achieved considerable FM airplay in the seventies, and became staples in album rock radio programming. At the same time, the group still maintained its individuality and uniquely artistic stance. While The Rolling Stones were singing &#8220;I know / It&#8217;s only rock and roll / But I like it&#8221; &#8212; hardly a compelling argument, in my book &#8212; Lou Reed was singing &#8220;Despite all the <i>amp</i>utations / you know you just could go out and dance to the Rock & Roll <i>sta</i>tion&#8221; &#8212; expressing a much more interesting, idiosyncratic and meaningful viewpoint. </p>
<p>The music on this album is also the closest of all the original four to conventional, late-sixties rock. Maureen Tucker, the group&#8217;s drummer since the departure of MacLise, was out on maternity leave, and was replaced by a more conventional artisan, Billy Yule. Electric guitars were favored over acoustic 12-strings, although with little feedback or distortion. Yet at the same time there are lovely, unique instrumental touches on the album, and experimental sounds, such as the odd instrumental break that punctuates the otherwise wholesome musical question, &#8220;Who Loves the Sun?&#8221; The electric guitar parts on &#8220;Sweet Jane&#8221; and &#8220;Rock & Roll&#8221; are also beautiful and interesting. </p>
<p>Although I&#8217;ve only mentioned three songs so far, the other seven on the album are all good as well. There is another long song, &#8220;Oh! Sweet Nuthin&#8217;,&#8221; but this one works, and is in fact another of the album&#8217;s highlights. The other material is all interesting and worthwhile.</p>

<p>This is the first of several albums assembled from bits and pieces found in the vaults after the band had gone on to achieve some degree of fame and respect. This first collection is the best of the lot, although it is still not up to standards set by the four original album releases. There are some good songs here, along with some that are merely interesting, but few if any of the recordings sound like finished versions. Some of these same songs are included on the boxed set as well. </p>
