<p>This is an excellent compilation of Hendrix&#8217; work. It features 20 of his best cuts, including singles and album tracks. Many of his most familiar works from his three completed studio albums, listed separately below, can be heard here, as well as four cuts from a projected fourth album, still in work at the time of his death. The final track is his rendition of &#8220;The Star Spangled Banner,&#8221; from Woodstock.</p>

<p>His first album contains some of his most accessible music, including &#8220;Purple Haze,&#8221; &#8220;Manic Depression,&#8221; &#8220;Hey Joe,&#8221; &#8220;The Wind Cries Mary,&#8221; &#8220;Foxey Lady,&#8221; &#8220;Stone Free&#8221; and &#8220;Red House.&#8221; Included are lots of great examples of his innovative guitar work. This is a great first album, a brilliant, brash burst of energy that announced Jimi&#8217;s arrival to the rock world.</p>

<p>Hendrix&#8217; second album is more reflective, philosophical and deliberate. Having established his identity with his first album, he seems intent here more on pleasing himself, developing his song writing and studio recording skills. Not the barn-burner that the first album was, but music that grows on you with repeated listenings.</p>

<p>This is a double album that represents Jimi&#8217;s most experimental and eclectic work. If the first album was a summary of what Jimi had achieved up to that point, and the second album was an indication of new directions he wanted to pursue, this third album is the realization of many of those goals. Each song is an attempt to pursue a new and fresh idea. One of the most daring and innovative albums in all of rock. </p>
