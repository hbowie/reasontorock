<p>This live album presents a musically experimental band and is a prime example of sixties psychedelia, both in terms of lyrics and extended instrumental improvisation. This double album also features keyboardist and singer Ron &#8220;Pigpen&#8221; McKernan on the rousing R&B number, &#8220;Turn On Your Love Light.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is a collections of great songs given mostly acoustic treatments. The group&#8217;s songwriting talents and Americana roots are very apparent on this album.  </p>

<p>Very similar in feel to <i>Workingman&#8217;s Dead</i>, and released in the same year, this is another generous collection of great songs given mostly acoustic treatments. The group&#8217;s songwriting talents and Americana roots are again on display on this album.  </p>

<p>Many of the later Grateful Dead releases were of their live shows. Once the industry transitioned from vinyl to CD, it was feasible to package an entire concert (usually several hours) as a single release, allowing listeners to hear pretty much exactly what the group had played on any particular night. </p>
<p>When viewed as collections of tracks, these sets all have their ups and downs, both in terms of the quality of the musical performances and as deliveries of compelling songs. However many Dead fans view each of these complete concert recordings as a unified work, and debate the relative merits of one evening&#8217;s concert compared to another&#8217;s. </p>
<p>For those wishing to experience one of these classic concerts, the recently released 3-CD set recorded at Cornell University, on May 8, 1977, in Barton Hall, is considered by many to be one of their finest, and was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2012. </p>
