<p>This two-CD compilation features the best songs from their catalog. Nearly every one of the 33 tracks is a gem worth having. Even if you end up purchasing their entire first two albums, listed below, this collection is worth having for its summary of the remainder of The Band&#8217;s career. Eleven of the tracks are from their first two releases, with the remaining twenty-two coming from their other albums.</p>

<p>While these are almost all good tracks, this single-CD collection is a bit skimpy. If you can only afford one album by The Band, then this is the one to get, but you&#8217;ll be missing a lot of great music. </p>

<p>This debut album by The Band features cover art painted by Bob Dylan, as well as three songs at least partially penned by him. His influence is evident in many of the other songs as well, whose writing credits are shared by Robbie Robertson and Richard Manuel. Also included is a cover version of &#8220;The Long Black Veil,&#8221; a country tune that has an older feel to it. </p>

<p>While the group&#8217;s second album is sometimes viewed as the group&#8217;s best, it is easy to make a case for this first collection as well. &#8220;Tears of Rage,&#8221; &#8220;The Weight,&#8221; &#8220;This Wheel&#8217;s On Fire,&#8221; and &#8220;I Shall Be Released&#8221; are all essential recordings, and every other song on the album adds to the collection. The lyrics on this album are a bit more adventurous and less literal than on the second, perhaps showing the influence of Dylan. This was a ground-breaking album when first released, and it still stands today as a monumental accomplishment.</p>

<p>The Band&#8217;s second album stands out for two reasons. First, the songs when taken together cover an astonishing range of American history and character, including the fall of the South in the Civil War, the civilization of the American West, the retirement of a sailor, the amorous adventures of a trucker, the approach of tornadoes in the Midwest, the end of slavery &#8212; the list goes on. This simple catalog doesn&#8217;t do the collection justice, as each song is an exquisitely etched portrait of a uniquely American time, place or character. </p>

<p>The second notable attribute of this album is the attention to detail given to the recording of every song. John Simon was credited as co-producer on this album, as well as playing several instruments, and he deserves much of the credit for the way each track was delicately crafted with vocals and instruments best suited to each song. Robbie Robertson and John Simon had begun planning the recording sessions for this album on a week-long trip to Hawaii. Most of the recording was done in a makeshift studio put together in a pool house, part of the property in the Hollywood Hills that they were renting from Sammy Davis Jr. The Band took up residence here, giving them the time and focus necessary to get all the details exactly right. The drums used on the album were an old set with wooden rims found in an L.A. pawn shop, on a shopping expedition by Levon Helm and Garth Hudson. The group thought they provided the perfect sound for this album that was so focused on America&#8217;s past.
