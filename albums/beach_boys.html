<p>This box set has a ton of good music, and is the most extensive compilation available. On the other hand, also included are demo tapes, previously unreleased studio works, backing tracks for obscure songs, and the necessary representation from their later albums &#8212; all of which I, for one, could do without. Perhaps more disappointing are the exclusion of some of the best non-Brian tracks, including &#8220;It&#8217;s About Time&#8221; and &#8220;Feel Flows,&#8221; both of which are absolute classics. I would think your money would probably be better spent selecting some of the original albums listed below rather than this, or any of the other, compilations.</p>

<p>This album includes the second tier of the group&#8217;s commercial successes. Again, lots of great material, but mostly focused on the group&#8217;s earlier period. </p>

<p>These are the group&#8217;s top commercial successes. Lots of great songs are included but there is no representation from the great albums that didn&#8217;t chart. If all you&#8217;re looking for is a collection of material you&#8217;ve probably already heard on the radio, then this is the CD for you. </p>

<p>The focus here is on the group&#8217;s later material. Classics such as &#8220;Surf&#8217;s Up&#8221; and &#8220;Long Promised Road&#8221; are included, but the second half of the CD includes singles from their final, retro period, such as remakes of Chuck Berry&#8217;s &#8220;Rock and Roll Music&#8221; and Buddy Holly&#8217;s &#8220;Peggy Sue.&#8221; These latter songs have little to recommend them. </p>

<p>One of the best things about The Beach Boys on CD is that almost all of their albums have been re-released in pairs, with two consecutively released albums on one CD. These are among the best deals available. This CD offers the group&#8217;s first two albums, on which they consolidate their early Surf sound. Includes &#8220;Surfin&#8217; Safari,&#8221; &#8220;409&#8221; and &#8220;Surfin&#8217; USA.&#8221; </p>

<p>Two more of the early albums, now beginning to show more of the Brian Wilson production influence. Shut Down Vol. 2 attempted to focus on cars rather than surf boards. Includes &#8220;Surfer Girl,&#8221; &#8220;Catch A Wave,&#8221; &#8220;Little Deuce Coupe,&#8221; &#8220;In My Room,&#8221; &#8220;Fun, Fun, Fun&#8221; and &#8220;Don&#8217;t Worry Baby.&#8221; </p>

<p><cite>Today</cite> was the logical predecessor to <cite>Pet Sounds.</cite> Brian had stopped touring by this time, and the music shows evidence of his expanding musical sophistication and increased focus on recording. Some of the songs also began to show signs of the mature introspection that was to dominate <cite>Pet Sounds.</cite> Includes &#8220;Do You Wanna Dance,&#8221; &#8220;When I Grow Up (To Be A Man),&#8221; &#8220;Help Me, Rhonda&#8221; and &#8220;California Girls.&#8221; </p>

<p>The group&#8217;s masterpiece. Comparable to The Beatles&#8217; <cite>Revolver,</cite> this was an album full of consistently solid material, possessing a unified group sound, and with lyrics based more on the songwriters&#8217; own lives, rather than the lowest common denominator of their audience&#8217;s expectations. Includes &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t It Be Nice,&#8221; &#8220;You Still Believe In Me,&#8221; Don&#8217;t Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder,&#8221; &#8220;Sloop John B,&#8221; &#8220;God Only Knows,&#8221; &#8220;I Know There&#8217;s An Answer,&#8221; &#8220;I Just Wasn&#8217;t Made For These Times&#8221; and &#8220;Caroline, No.&#8221; </p>

<p>Rather than the expected masterpiece of <cite>Smile,</cite> the group&#8217;s next album &#8212; an altogether different work called <cite>Smiley Smile</cite> &#8212; was mostly significant for its relaxed silliness. <cite>Wild Honey</cite> was an attempt to infuse the group&#8217;s sound with R&amp;B. Includes &#8220;Heroes and Villains,&#8221; &#8220;Good Vibrations,&#8221; &#8220; &#8220;Wild Honey,&#8221; &#8220;Darlin&#8217;&#8221; and &#8220;Here Comes The Night.&#8221;</p>

<p>More laid-back music from a group still lacking any clear musical direction, but these two albums still feature some notable music. Includes &#8220;Busy Doin&#8217; Nothin&#8217;,&#8221; &#8220;Transcendental Meditation,&#8221; &#8220;Do It Again,&#8221; &#8220;I Can Hear Music,&#8221; &#8220;Bluebirds Over The Mountain,&#8221; &#8220;All I Want To Do,&#8221; &#8220;Never Learn Not To Love,&#8221; &#8220;Break Away,&#8221; &#8220;Our Prayer&#8221; and &#8220;Cabinessence.&#8221; </p>

<p>This is my favorite CD among the Beach Boys&#8217; various packages. <cite>Sunflower</cite> and <cite>Surf&#8217;s Up</cite> are both interesting albums with lots of variety and lots of great music, even if neither is cohesive or consistent enough to be called entirely great. Similar to Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young&#8217;s <cite>Deja Vu</cite> or The Beatles&#8217; self-titled &#8220;white&#8221; album, the varying musical approaches and thematic concerns are widely divergent. &#8220;This Whole World,&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s About Time,&#8221; &#8220;Long Promised Road,&#8221; &#8220;Feel Flows&#8221; &#8220;&#8217;Til I Die&#8221; and &#8220;Surf&#8217;s Up&#8221; are arguably all as good as it gets. Then you have Bruce Johnston&#8217;s pleasant schmaltz &#8212; &#8220;Deirdre,&#8221; &#8220;Tears In The Morning&#8221; and &#8220;Disney Girls&#8221; &#8212; which can either attract or alienate you, depending on your vulnerability to this kind of stuff. Other tracks are clearly not great, but are strange in various interesting ways: &#8220;Got To Know The Woman,&#8221; &#8220;Don&#8217;t Go Near The Water,&#8221; &#8220;Student Demonstration Time&#8221; and &#8220;A Day In The Life Of A Tree,&#8221; most notably. The combination of the two CDs makes for an interesting, idiosyncratic and ultimately powerful collection of music. </p>

<p><cite>Carl and the Passions</cite> gave brother Carl the chance to front the band for an album, and resulted in some pleasant if generally slight recordings. <cite>Holland</cite> was a more ambitious effort, and stands beside <cite>Sunflower</cite> and <cite>Surf&#8217;s Up</cite> as the highlights of this period for The Beach Boys. Includes &#8220;You Need A Mess of Help to Stand Alone,&#8221; &#8220;Marcella,&#8221; &#8220;All This Is That,&#8221; &#8220;Sail On Sailor,&#8221; &#8220;California Saga,&#8221; &#8220;The Trader,&#8221; &#8220;Only With You&#8221; and &#8220;Funky Pretty.&#8221; </p>
