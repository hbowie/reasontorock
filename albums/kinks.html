<p>An utterly enchanting album, featuring classics like &#8220;Dandy,&#8221; &#8220;Party Line,&#8221; &#8220;Too Much On My Mind,&#8221; &#8220;Holiday in Waikiki,&#8221; &#8220;Fancy,&#8221; and &#8220;Sunny Afternoon.&#8221; Every track is unique in theme and treatment. Nicky Hopkins graces the album on piano and harpsichord, adding tasteful touches on many tunes. </p>

<p>Not as consistent as <cite>Face to Face,</cite> but &#8220;Waterloo Sunset&#8221; alone is nearly worth the price of admission, and there are many other gems as well.</p>

<p>The title track is a classic, and again there are other worthwhile efforts on the album. </p>

<p>Who but the Kinks could write a rave-up about the nineteenth century English Queen known for her moral propriety? &#8220;Victoria&#8221; is a sparkling song, contrasting the power of a well-ordered society with the aimlessness of the late 20th century. Other songs elaborate on the overall theme and extend the story, with many great tracks. </p>

<p>&#8220;Lola&#8221; is an essential song, as is &#8220;Apeman,&#8221; and the rest of the album is memorable as well. </p>

<p>Certainly one of the best Kinks albums in their collection. Here they closely observe a number of elements of modern life. Ray&#8217;s tone and approach are as varied as his subjects. After a number of albums of carefully crafted pop, they return here to a harder, more abandoned sound reminiscent of their early hits, such as &#8220;You Really Got Me.&#8221; A wonderful album. </p>

<p>My absolute favorite Kinks album. The Kinks draw heavily on their English music hall roots, featuring a full horn section, including trombone and tuba, as well as the more customary trumpet and saxophone. The songs generally take a look at the lives of performers, including Hollywood stars (&#8220;Celluloid Heros&#8221;) as well as those of the Kinks themselves (&#8220;Sitting in My Hotel&#8221; and others). Also included is the fabulous &#8220;Supersonic Rocket Ship,&#8221; which is sort of a traditional British answer to American groups like Jefferson Starship, featuring lines like &#8220;We&#8217;re going to travel faster than light, so do up your overcoat tight.&#8221; Absolutely original and totally unalloyed Kinks.</p>

<p>&#8221;Education&#8221; alone is worth the price of admission. Many of the other songs are memorable, but originality seems to be generally sacrificed for thematic cohesion. This is one of the Kinks albums during this period that was conceived and executed as an elaborate stage show for their tours. While these concept albums added some variety and challenge to the Kinks live shows, they often failed to make for consistently compelling studio efforts. </p>

<p>Not consistently great, but the title track is one of their best, along with &#8220;Jukebox Music,&#8221; &#8220;Stormy Sky,&#8221; and &#8220;Life Goes On.&#8221;</p>
