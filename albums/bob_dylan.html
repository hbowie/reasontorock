<p>This is Dylan&#8217;s first album that was all electric. The subject matter spans the range of &#8220;protest&#8221; songs, such as the title tune, and more personal ones, such as &#8220;Like A Rolling Stone.&#8221; The accompanying musicians were given the freedom to accompany Dylan in new and unusual ways. The most famous story is of Al Kooper, who arrived at the sessions planning on playing electric guitar, then switched to organ once he heard Michael Bloomfield&#8217;s playing on guitar. Kooper&#8217;s noodlings on organ were immortalized as an essential element of the recording &#8220;Like A Rolling Stone,&#8221; and his impromptu approach was hailed as a fresh new element of rock. </p>

<p>However they came together, the sessions were magical, and the result is one of Dylan&#8217;s most lyrically and musically compelling. Absolutely essential.</p>

<p>This double album was perhaps Dylan&#8217;s boldest and richest work. The accompanying musicians, including Robbie Robertson of the Band on guitar, added a rich tapestry to Dylan&#8217;s voice and songs. The songs themselves are unremittingly personal, presenting haunting visions of the fragility and complexity of human relationships. The tone of the songs ranges from the biting humor of &#8220;Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat,&#8221; to the tender warmth of &#8220;Just Like A Woman,&#8221; to the existential angst of &#8220;Stuck Inside of Mobile With The Memphis Blues Again.&#8221; Dylan&#8217;s amazing voice, as rich and textured as aged bourbon, shifts with each changing mood, always providing the perfect vehicle for the words and their emotions. The musical accompaniment is multi-layered, perfectly matching the words and their swirling images. This is an album that redefined and immeasurably expanded the scope of rock music. </p>
