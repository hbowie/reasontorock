<p>This is an expanded version of the band&#8217;s greatest hits collection, originally released in 1970. With 17 tracks, this is a generous collection of most of the best music produced by the group when it still consisted primarily of Kantner, Slick, Balin, Kaukonen, Casady and Dryden.</p>

<p>This two-disc set is probably the best choice for someone not interested in acquiring the Airplane&#8217;s entire catalog, since it includes a generous sampling of tracks that represents the full range of the group, including most of the must-have recordings. </p>

<p>The band&#8217;s inaugural album featured female vocalist Signe Anderson rather than Grace Slick, and drummer Skip Spence rather than Spencer Dryden, so this was not yet the classic line-up that would be preserved over the next five albums. This album features &#8220;Let&#8217;s Get Together,&#8221; which would become a hit for the Youngbloods, and also includes &#8220;It&#8217;s No Secret,&#8221; by Marty Balin, and &#8220;Come Up the Years,&#8221; by Balin and Kantner. The rest of the album shows lots of promise, and displays many of the ingredients that would become trademarks for the band, but this is clearly a freshman effort. </p>

<p>This is the first album by what would become the classic Airplane line-up, now including Grace Slick and Spencer Dryden. Slick brought two songs with her to the group, one that she had written, &#8220;White Rabbit,&#8221; and one penned by her brother-in-law, Darby Slick, &#8220;Somebody to Love.&#8221; Both became top ten singles. The album contains tremendous variety, including some instrumental finger-picking by Jorma Kaukonen on &#8220;Embryonic Journey.&#8221; Despite being very intentionally experimental, eclectic and psychedelic, there is not a trace of self-indulgence, and the entire album holds up amazingly well, both as a collection of songs and as a unified work. Other tracks included &#8212; almost all of them notable &#8212; are &#8220;She Has Funny Cars,&#8221; &#8220;My Best Friend,&#8221; the achingly beautiful love songs &#8220;Today&#8221; and &#8220;Comin&#8217; Back To Me,&#8221; &#8220;3/5 of a Mile in Ten Seconds,&#8221; &#8220;D. C. B. A. - 25,&#8221; &#8220;How Do You Feel,&#8221; and an amazingly prophetic rant about the electronic media, &#8220;Plastic Fantastic Lover.&#8221; </p>

<p>Whereas <cite>Surrealistic Pillow</cite> took a couple of weeks to record, <cite>After Bathing at Baxter&#8217;s</cite> took months. Where &#8220;White Rabbit&#8221; was a brilliantly focused and structured song about expanding your mind through the use of drugs, <cite>Baxter&#8217;s</cite> was a sprawling, diffuse, eclectic, sophisticated work that illustrated the results of such mind expansion. The group takes risks here in all directions at once, seemingly without the slightest fear of artistic or commercial failure, and, even though they seem foolhardy for working without a net, they never slip, and it somehow all seems to work. Musicians, music, words and vocalists all intertwine effortlessly and with superb effect. For a band with only one or two albums under its belt, and under great pressure from audience and industry to extend the commercial success enjoyed by <cite>Surrealistic Pillow</cite> and its hit singles, <cite>Baxter&#8217;s</cite> is a singularly brave and admirable effort. </p>

<p>Some of the better known tracks on this album are &#8220;The Ballad of You &amp; Me &amp; Pooneil,&#8221; &#8220;Young Girl Sunday Blues,&#8221; &#8220;Martha,&#8221; &#8220;Wild Tyme,&#8221; &#8220;Rejoyce,&#8221; &#8220;Watch Her Ride&#8221; and &#8220;Won&#8217;t You Try/Saturday Afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Where <cite>Baxter&#8217;s</cite> seemed to be a sort of audio collage reflecting the band&#8217;s interests, activities and lifestyle &#8212; a postcard from planet Airplane, ending &#8220;Wish you were here&#8221; &#8212; many of the individual tracks on <cite>Crown of Creation</cite> are both more distinct and more focused works, each its own particular world, rather than just different rooms in the sprawling mansion of <cite>Surrealistic Pillow</cite>. At this point, too, the band seems capable of commenting cogently on the society they are rebelling against, rather than just thumbing their nose at it. </p>

<p>&#8220;Lather,&#8221; written and sung by Grace Slick, is a fable about a child-man turning 30, and being told that he is no longer young. The song is a small masterpiece, a pure distillation of the culture and counter-culture unfolding at the time. What makes the song so effective, and so singular, is its emotional distance from its subject, its ability to evoke emotions through words, sounds and story rather than the tone of the singer, and its willingness for the subject to ultimately be a tragic figure, rather than a heroic one, such as The Who&#8217;s &#8220;Happy Jack&#8221; or The Beatles&#8217; &#8220;Fool on the Hill.&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;Triad,&#8221; also sung by Slick, is an entirely serious look at the possibility of a romantic threesome. Like &#8220;Lather,&#8221; the tone of the singer is thoughtful and reflective, rather than emotional and forceful. The song was written by David Crosby, then of The Byrds, and his bandmates had already refused to feature the song on one of their albums before Crosby offered it to the Airplane. While Crosby&#8217;s song as sung by a man already crossed society&#8217;s norms, Slick&#8217;s reading stretches the bounds of social propriety even further. This recording is a beautiful, and entirely unique, love song. </p>

<p>The title track, by Paul Kantner, is a powerful exploration of the conflict felt by youth in the late sixties. Music and words sketch a conflict between an older generation that prizes stability, and a younger generation that wants to rock the boat. The song structure is non-traditional, more like a spare, modern poem set to music than anything like a traditional repeated verse-chorus structure. </p>

<p>This is a live album, notable for inclusion of several of the group&#8217;s best songs, as well as bearing witness to the group&#8217;s style and power on stage. The album features consistently great performances by the entire group and shows the full range of the band&#8217;s concert repertoire, including such gems as &#8220;Fat Angel,&#8221; by Donovan, the traditional blues &#8220;Rock Me Baby,&#8221; &#8220;The Other Side of This Life,&#8221; by folk singer Fred Neil and &#8220;Bear Melt,&#8221; an exercise in group improvisation that stretches out for over eleven minutes. Also included are &#8220;3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds,&#8221; &#8220;Somebody to Love,&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s No Secret&#8221; and &#8220;Plastic Fantastic Lover.&#8221; The latest CD reissue also includes live versions of &#8220;Today,&#8221; &#8220;Watch Her Ride,&#8221; and &#8220;Won&#8217;t You Try.&#8221; </p>

<p>This was the last great album by the classic lineup, augmented on this recording by keyboardist Nicky Hopkins (who around this time was managing to show up on every other rock album released by better groups on either side of the Atlantic) as well as Jerry Garcia on pedal steel guitar. This is a beautifully balanced and sequenced album, starting and ending with the thematic bookends of &#8220;We Can Be Together&#8221; and &#8220;Volunteers,&#8221; but also containing: </p>

<ul>

<li>the Airplane&#8217;s version of &#8220;Wooden Ships,&#8221; co-written by Paul Kantner, David Crosby and Stephen Stills, and also recorded by Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash; 
</li>
<li>&#8220;A Song for all Seasons,&#8221; Spencer Dryden&#8217;s country-tinged song about the internal problems being experienced by the band; 
</li>
<li>&#8220;The Farm,&#8221; the Airplane&#8217;s song about the bliss of rural retreat, which was becoming <i>de rigueur</i> for rock bands about this time, featuring the immortal lines &#8220;Here comes my next door neighbor, coming down the road, he always looks so regal, riding on his toad&#8221;; 
</li>
<li>&#8220;Good Shepherd,&#8221; a reworking of a traditional blues song, sung by Jorma, with a wonderful treatment by the entire band; 
</li>
<li>&#8220;Hey Frederick,&#8221; a Grace Slick number fusing modern poetry with psychedelic rock; 
</li>
<li>&#8220;Turn My Life Down,&#8221; a beautiful, bittersweet, thoughtful song by Jorma, with lead vocals by Marty, and backing vocals by the rest of the band, and beautiful lead guitar by Jorma. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a wonderful, timeless album, and a fitting testament to the soul of this great group of musicians. </p>
