<p>As mentioned above, this collection garnered lots of FM airplay when it was first released, and served more than any of the band&#8217;s earlier releases to establish many of the included tracks as familiar classics. This is a great collection, although it is hard to see why, with the additional purchase of only two more CDs, you wouldn&#8217;t want to own the entire Buffalo Springfield collection. </p>

<p>For those who simply can&#8217;t get enough Buffalo Springfield. Lots of demos and alternate versions of songs, alternate mixes of the complete first two albums, but no live songs. (Although the group was supposed to have been spectacular in live performances, the only decent live recording is reputed to be a bootleg, recorded in Dallas on April 20, 1968). But most people will be better off simply owning all three of their originally released albums.</p>

<p>Some claim that this debut album suffers from poor production, but it is still full of energy and lots of great tracks. This is probably the most cohesive album, with all the band members collaborating on every track. Includes &#8220;For What It&#8217;s Worth,&#8221; &#8220;Sit Down I Think I Love You,&#8221; &#8220;Nowadays Clancy Can&#8217;t Even Sing,&#8221; &#8220;Flying On The Ground Is Wrong&#8221; and &#8220;Do I Have To Come Right Out And Say It.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is probably the best of their three albums, if I have to choose one. &#8220;Bluebird&#8221; and &#8220;Broken Arrow&#8221; are successfully ambitious compositions by Stills and Young, respectively. Other well-known tracks are &#8220;Mr. Soul,&#8221; &#8220;Expecting to Fly,&#8221; and &#8220;Rock and Roll Woman,&#8221; but every cut is good.</p>

<p>By this time the band was about to break up, and many of the tracks here were recorded without all group members present. Still, the results are hard to argue with. Features &#8220;Pretty Girl Why,&#8221; &#8220;I Am A Child&#8221; and &#8220;Kind Woman.&#8221;</p>
