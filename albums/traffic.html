<p>This is a good 2-CD collection of Traffic&#8217;s best efforts. It is fairly evenly divided between their early and later periods. </p>

<p>This is a good single CD collection of their best stuff, again about evenly divided between early and late periods. Since this album contains 15 tracks, compared to 26 on the double-CD package above, this might be seen as a better value.</p>

<p>Traffic&#8217;s first album was released in differing English and American versions, with and without their early singles, and this confusion has carried over into some of the CD editions as well. No matter what it is called &#8212; <cite>Mr. Fantasy</cite> or <cite>Heaven Is In Your Mind</cite> &#8212; make sure it includes fifteen or sixteen tracks, as both of these recent versions do. Some of the material here is dispensable, but the title cuts and others are classics, and there is lots of good stuff here. Includes &#8220;Heaven Is In Your Mind,&#8221; &#8220;No Face, No Name, No Number,&#8221; &#8220;Dear Mr. Fantasy,&#8221; &#8220;Dealer,&#8221; &#8220;Coloured Rain,&#8221; &#8220;Paper Sun,&#8221; and &#8220;Smiling Phases.&#8221; Produced by Jimmy Miller.</p>

<p>This is really their best album, and it can stand alongside any rock group&#8217;s best work. Mason was still recording with them, giving them a broad range of interesting songs along with his distinctive folky vocals, and the group had developed its instrumental abilities to perfectly showcase each unique song. Every cut on here is a classic. Includes &#8220;You Can All Join In,&#8221; &#8220;Pearly Queen,&#8221; &#8220;Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring,&#8221; &#8220;Feelin&#8217; Alright,&#8221; &#8220;Forty Thousand Headmen,&#8221; &#8220;Cryin&#8217; to be Heard&#8221; and &#8220;No Time to Live.&#8221; Produced by Jimmy Miller.</p>

<p>This album is really surprisingly good, considering that it was thrown together at the last minute to satisfy some contractual commitments. Side one of the original album (the first five cuts) were recorded in the studio, and include some great material. Side two (the last two tracks) were recorded live, with the group performing as a trio. Neither of the live songs are the group&#8217;s compositions, nor are they any sort of rock or blues standards. They are both longish tracks, with soulful vocals from Winwood and interesting musicianship, especially from Winwood on organ and Wood on flute. The group succeeds fairly well on both of these outings, and these live cuts stand testimony today to the group&#8217;s extraordinary ambition at the time. Includes &#8220;Shanghai Noodle Factory&#8221; and &#8220;Medicated Goo.&#8221;</p>

<p>This started life as a Winwood solo effort, with Steve playing most of the instruments, then ended up as a collaboration with Wood and Capaldi. This album began what I think of as their later phase, without Dave Mason, and with a more jazzy, meditative feel to the music. Their were only six cuts on the original album, all of them semi-lengthy, with lots of instrumental work. While this is the most consistent of their later albums, and is definitely worth a listen, I tend to prefer their earlier period. There is a sort of emotional barrenness to much of their later work that contrasts starkly with the rich, full emotional range expressed on their earlier albums. And while the early albums sounded collaborative in the best sense, with a group that was much more than just the sum of its parts, the later stuff often sounds like it was conceived and composed by a single mind. Includes the title cut and &#8220;Empty Pages.&#8221; </p>

<p>The title cut is a 12-minute jam that is hypnotic and entrancing, and is a good example of early rock/jazz fusion. &#8220;Hidden Treasure,&#8221; &#8220;Rainmaker&#8221; and &#8220;Many a Mile to Freedom&#8221; are pleasantly folksy, in the vein of &#8220;John Barleycorn.&#8221; &#8220;Rock and Roll Stew&#8221; and &#8220;Light Up or Leave Me Alone&#8221; are intended more as rockers, and are the least interesting of the album&#8217;s offerings. Jim Gordon on drums (from Derek and the Dominos) and Rick Grech on bass (from Blind Faith) fill out the sound. </p>
