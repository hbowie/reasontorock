<p>This is only a single CD, only goes through &#8216;66, and is not a lot of music by today&#8217;s standards &#8212; these are the same songs released on the original LP &#8212; but they are all great tracks, and this might be a reasonable alternative for someone who wants to purchase some of the great middle period Stones albums in their entirety.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a single purchase to introduce you to the Rolling Stones, then this is probably the best value. This two-CD set has a good selection of tracks from all the albums they released during their most creative years. </p>

<p>This three-CD boxed set contains A and B sides from all the Stones singles up through the <i>Sticky Fingers</i> album. It has many of the same tracks featured on the <i>Hot Rocks</i> collection, plus some tracks that might otherwise be hard to find on CD.</p>

<p>This is the best album from the Brian Jones era, with his eclectic musical touches all over the best songs on the album. Includes &#8220;Paint It Black,&#8221; &#8220;Stupid Girl,&#8221; &#8220;Under My Thumb&#8221; and &#8220;Lady Jane.&#8221; Some of these songs have often been called misogynistic, but inappropriately so, I think. &#8220;Stupid Girl&#8221; and &#8220;Under My Thumb&#8221; both talk about very particular characters, and make no statements about women in general. Jagger and the Stones were simply willing to be more honest than most, as was often the case.</p>

<p>One of the greatest rock albums ever made. Every song on here reveals intelligence and depth. An extended meditation on the nature of reality and perception. Varied arrangements, from bare-bone blues to a much fuller sound. Nicky Hopkins adds piano to many of the songs. Great production by Jimmy Miller, with all the vocal and instrumental lines standing out like individual beads of water on a leaf after a spring rain. Includes &#8220;Sympathy For The Devil&#8221; and &#8220;Street Fighting Man.&#8221; </p>

<p>An essential companion piece to <i>Beggar&#8217;s Banquet.</i> The title was a take-off from the Beatles song title, &#8220;Let It Be.&#8221; Whereas <i>Beggar&#8217;s Banquet</i> was about the Stones looking out at the world, <i>Let It Bleed</i> was more about the world&#8217;s perception of the Stones. Again produced by Jimmy Miller and again featuring Nicky Hopkins, as well as other guest instrumentalists and vocalists. Includes &#8220;You Can&#8217;t Always Get What You Want,&#8221; &#8220;Midnight Rambler,&#8221; &#8220;Gimme Shelter&#8221; and &#8220;Let It Bleed.&#8221; </p>
