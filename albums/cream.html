<p>Fortunately for listeners, Cream had the sort of career perfectly suited to a boxed set such as this one. All of the group&#8217;s released studio tracks are included here in their entirety, plus many live performances, some not previously released. In other words, this collection makes all of their other albums unnecessary. This is a wise purchase for anyone interested in more than a single-CD greatest hits collection. </p>

<p>Recently remastered, generous collection of material, reasonably priced: it would be hard to go wrong with this compilation. </p>

<p>This was Cream&#8217;s first album. Producer Pappalardi was not yet working with them, and the band had few original compositions. Most of the songs are reworked blues numbers. Despite these limitations, the album is still a lot of fun, although there is nothing here to indicate what would come later. In retrospect, it is easy to see that at this point they were still a trio of great musicians struggling to find some identity as a band.</p>

<p>This, Cream&#8217;s second outing, was easily their best single album. Dowd and Pappalardi had begun working with them, Clapton was at his scorching best on guitar, the songs were still short and memorable, and some great original compositions balanced the blues numbers. A classic.</p>

<p>By this point the band had achieved fame for its live shows, resulting in a double album of mostly strange studio work (&#8220;Pressed Rat and Warthog&#8221; being one such number) on the first disc, coupled with four lengthy live outings on the second. This was also a sort of classic, though, illustrating the full range of the band&#8217;s work and, by extension, the breadth of ambition possible in rock at the time. As odd a collection as it was, this eagerly anticipated album was one of the biggest sellers of the late sixties. Whatever you think of the quality of the music (I think it is something of a mixed bag), it is hard not to be awed that such astonishing musical diversity could find so large an audience willing to accept its full range. </p>

<p>One last attempt to cash in on the band&#8217;s reputation, this album attempts to duplicate the live/studio combination on a single disc, but ends up sounding more like a collection of odds and ends thrown together to make a complete album. There is nothing among the live performances here to match the best of their earlier work, and no great psychedelic blues hit among the studio tracks. &#8220;Badge,&#8221; authored and performed with George Harrison, is the most memorable song, and was said by Clapton to be an attempt to retreat from the excess sometimes produced by Cream, and instead to emulate the more cohesive and restrained work of The Band. </p>
