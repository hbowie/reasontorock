        <p>The table below summarizes, in chronological order, the major technological advances that influenced the development of rock music. As we will see, one or more of these technological developments were key enablers for almost every element of rock music. As with most, if not all, artistic movements, it was new technology that created the possibility for a new art form to emerge. </p>
