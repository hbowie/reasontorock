I received a lovely e-mail recently from Peter Z. His note was brief, so I'll ask your indulgence as I share the whole thing here:

> I stumbled upon your site from a youtube comment.  It was the best mouse click I ever made. I loved [your analysis of All Along the Watchtower](http://www.reasontorock.com/tracks/watchtower.html).  It has been my favourite song for years, but after reading your post, I am more in love with it.  I never paid attention to the lyrics to that extent, and never noticed Hendrix's genius.  I only hope that more readers will discover your fantastic site and rekindle or further their love for rock music. And I hope you will continue to reflect and share your thoughts with the world. 

For some time now, I have been idly contemplating doing something new with the *[Reason to Rock](http://www.reasontorock.com)* site, and Peter's kind and timely words were enough to push me over the edge and motivate me to reboot / reinvigorate / refresh my earlier efforts. 

My original goal was to write and publish an online book about Rock music as an art form, and I still believe that those ambitions remain well satisfied by the current content, so all of that will remain intact and available. In addition, though, I am adding this blog, that will feature more regular additions. In many cases, these blog posts may be shorter and more casual than the existing book chapters, but they will remain focused on music and the arts, and hopefully will satisfy both my own urges to continue writing as well as the interests of those who, like Peter, may wish to continue reading. 

Thanks to Peter and other gracious readers who have provided such kind and encouraging feedback over the years.
