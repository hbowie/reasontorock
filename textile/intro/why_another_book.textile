Much has already been written about rock music, including many books on the subject, and much of this material has been very worthwhile. So why, at this late date, do I feel the need to add yet another work on the topic?

I believe this book has four unique contributions to offer.

#	A focus on the elements of rock music that distinguish it from related forms.
#	Many comparisons to other art forms, such as poetry and film.
#	An aesthetic for rock -- a value system that can help to separate great examples of the form from lesser works.
#	Detailed critical analysis of individual tracks.
