A reader can progress sequentially from front to back, can navigate to a particular section or chapter using the table of contents, or can follow hyperlinked references from one chapter to another. 

Bibliographic references for quotations are linked to their respective entries in the bibliography. 

The Web site provides links to Amazon.com for recommended books and albums and bibliography listings.   

Finally, the pages describing great examples of rock music have text links embedded in them that say: "Audio clip - 60K":../audio/school_day/up_in_the_morning.mp3. On the Web site, clicking on one of these will download a small MP3 file to play.
