For each featured artist, I provide a list of albums worthy of your consideration, along with some explanation of my ratings. These assessments are based on several factors: the quality of the tracks contained on each album; the number of tracks included; plus the overall cohesion of each collection. I only list or provide commentary on albums that I can recommend to at least some degree. 

For each album listed, I supply one of the following three ratings. 

* Essential (5 Stars) -- These are albums that I believe should be part of every rock music collection. 
* Recommended (4 Stars) -- While not essential, these are still albums unquestionably worth owning. 
* Worthy (3 Stars) -- Albums to consider purchasing for your favorite artists, or for a really complete collection.
