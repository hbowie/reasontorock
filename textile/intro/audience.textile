This book is really intended for two distinct audiences.

The first group of readers includes those relatively new to rock music, who want an introduction to the art form that takes them beyond a mere history, and beyond an exposure to various popular hits of the era.

The second intended audience consists of those already familiar with rock music, who want a different perspective on the music, and a deeper understanding of the aesthetic dynamics that make rock music a unique art form.
