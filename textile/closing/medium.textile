I decided to publish the book ??Reason to Rock: Rock Music as Art Form?? via the World Wide Web, rather than via traditional print, for several reasons:

* Because the Web is a fluid medium that allows easy revisions; 
* To exploit the multi-media potential of the Web, by allowing readers to listen to small samples of music taken from example tracks; 
* To encourage reader feedback that can then further improve the quality of the text; 
* To reach a broad audience;
* To minimize the cost of publication and distribution;
* To allow readers to easily hyperlink through the work as their interests take them, rather than imposing a strictly linear structure on the reading experience; 
* So that I can provide links to other Web sites and additional information available through the Internet.
