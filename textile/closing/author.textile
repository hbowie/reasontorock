Herb Bowie graduated from high school in Annapolis, Maryland in 1969. He was one of four National Merit scholars in his graduating class. His formal education continued at the "University of Michigan":http://www.umich.edu, where he earned a B.A. in English literature (after abandoning an Engineering scholarship from Lockheed). While at Ann Arbor, the author reviewed rock concerts and albums for the school's newspaper, "??The Michigan Daily??":http://www.michigandaily.com.

After graduating from college, the author managed to build a career in Information Technology (despite his degree in English). He currently holds a responsible IT management position for a major American aerospace company. 

Herb met Pauline, the love of his life, in 1978. On their first date he took her to see the Robert Altman film of Raymond Chandler's novel, ??The Long Goodbye??. They were married in 1980, and moved to Arizona in 1986. Stephen was born to them exactly one year later. Stephen has now graduated from the University of Michigan, and Herb and Pauline live in Seattle with their Golden Retriever, Hank.
